796220834,50,"July 8, 2021",Fabulous,"After an hour drive from Makkum in the Friesland province meandering through the eye catching landscape of the Netherlands finds the rural giving way to the urban landscape of Amsterdam. The walk to this hidden gem of an establishment is well worth it - from the lush gardens to the mellow ambience of the interior. Very much a plant based lunch, the convivial De Kas team add that extra appeal. Despite only opening at 12pm, our online 12:15pm booking was certainly needed with all tables full an hour or so later although you wouldn't know with the cavernous ceiling masking the general hullabaloo. De Kas is doing everything right in a most unassuming way - long may it continue. Goed gedaan"
792789843,50,"June 16, 2021",Nice Restaurant,"If you go for 6 dishes they appear to have a weekly menu of 6 options and the restaurant will serve 4 of these on any given evening. The order comes in random apart from one which is a main which is just before the 2 deserts. The amuse bouches were very very nice as were all the mains. We had a lovely deserts especially the goats cheese cheesecake. Onlyu minor gripe was waiting a little while for a bottle of wine at one point but really thats me really reaching out and trying to find any flaws with the evening. Would highly recommend. Anyone wants to know how much, 2 oysters, 6 course meal, 2 glasses of wine, a bottle of wine (all at the low end price range) came to around 100 Euros a person. I have eaten in a lot of hi end restaurants and this was more than reasonable. 5 stars highly recommended."
788354190,50,"May 9, 2021",Absolutely Delicious Food,"My new favorite restaurant in Amsterdam!It prides itself on serving creative and absolutely delicious food mostly grown on site or at their farm, complemented by some meat and seafood sourced sustainably. But at the same time, they have no issue to cater for vegetarians or any other requests.You also get extremely attentive service, that is friendly, efficient and can provide great recommendations.I can't wait to be back again very soon!"
778227856,50,"November 30, 2020",So fresh! So tasty!,Ingredients were freshly picked from the garden of the restaurant. Each dish was beautifully arranged and tasted so good. Warm and attentive service throughout the dinner.
776539041,50,"November 5, 2020",Wonderful vegetarian food - a must visit,"Truly an awesome vegetarian experience. The food is exceptional, and the ""greenhouse"" environment is out of this world. One of the best vegetarian restaurants anywhere."
773167483,50,"October 5, 2020",Just have one word for it: excellent!!,"We had a fantastic dinner, they took the Corona measurements very seriously and we felt safe all the way, the tables are set far apart in a very large restaurant. The staff was wearing masks the whole evening.De kas, greenhouse in English, delivers when it comes to food and service. Amazing tasty dishes for a more than fair price. We ate at Michelin star restaurants before and we left amazed thinking why this has not received one. We will come back 100%"
772583624,50,"September 30, 2020",Really fancy place to eat!,Extremely beautiful inside the glasshouse. Service is outstanding and waiters have good knowledge about dietary restrictions like vegan food and food allergies.
772499627,20,"September 30, 2020",Disappoiting experience,"I read the incredible positive reviews and I had very high expectations.... unfortunately not met at all.Hygiene and COVID prevention: very low. The waiters are not wearing a mask or gloves and they are coming to your table and speak to you at a very close distance.Food: some products were quite repetitive ( poor choice in a menu' that you cannot choose) and the flavors were mostly or totally absent or incredibly heavy. The brot with olives was embaressing....incredibly fat and bitter.Artichokes with thorns and a dish with almost raw pumpkin really not eatable.The amuses were fine, the bread very tasty, the dessert interesting.....I find it inappropriate to let customers pay for tab water.The service was nice and friendly, but no respect of COVID rules either in the kitchen or in the service.Honestly, after this experience, I would not come back to this place and I would not recommend it."
771311025,50,"September 21, 2020",Greenhouse Dining Experience,"Located in a greenhouse in a park, this incredible garden/green-centered restaurant that produces their own produce (some of which you can see happening).The food was fresh, bursting with flavor, and presented beautifully. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful, which only added to the overall fun vibe. Also, since they have vegan options, I am eager to take some of my friends back later this year for the experience."
770692986,10,"September 16, 2020",Total disregard for hygiene standards,"This is a beautiful and very special restaurant serving amazingly delicious food. No question. BUT: I was appalled that in Covid times, neither the kitchen staff nor the waiters were wearing masks.. Worse: The waiters still come to the table and explain every detail of the respective dish they were serving. Six courses, six different waiters, all spraying their breath over the food. This restaurant has a high chance of becoming the next super-spreader. Totally irresponsible."
770436565,40,"September 15, 2020","Nice fresh products, great location","The food was nice and fresh, and the surrounding is amazing. Service was rather good too. Some more aromatics could have been added to the dishes in our view, and some of the dishes had repetitive elements (eg: fried fish/seaweed). The starter was very light and simple.A bit disappointed about some of the local/environmental friendly aspects eg: use of UV lights to grow plants (high energy use), offering sparkling or flat water before suggesting tap water (which ended up being charged at 4 euros as well!).Still interesting flavours and lots of amuses in addition to the fixed menu. Delicious bread too!"
770198500,50,"September 13, 2020","Fresh, tasty and beautifully presented food","This restaurant is located in a park in the south of Amsterdam easily reachable by tram from the centre. The restaurant is a massive green house in which they also produce a lot of their own vegetable and herbs. There’s also a gorgeous vegetable garden around the building. Food is fresh, full of flavour and beautifully presented. Staff are friendly and extremely helpful. This is the second time I’ve visited and they never fail to impress."
764380901,10,"August 12, 2020",Long curly hair in the food,"We were really looking forward to our dinner at this restaurant and the place is beautiful, presentation was amazing however when I got to my third course which wa a stuffed zucchini I had to pull out of my throat a massive long Curley hair!! It was awful and ruined the rest of the experience, we had about 4 more courses on top and I couldn’t even eat them and enjoy them because that long hair stuffier in the zucchini was disgusting!! I want to say I would come back but the staff didn’t even apologize or do any compensation for this, instead we got a bill that was over £200. I have to say I didn’t expect they will treat us like this after this experience. We won’t be coming back. For high end place like this you would expect some sort of compensation."
762348700,40,"July 31, 2020",Restaurant De Kas - Local Affinity!,"Local Affinity!The menu tells the story of the garden. Supplemented with some fish or meat, the vegetables play the main role. Harvested from the land in the morning, served in the afternoon. The most beautiful and freshest vegetables, from plant to plate as quickly as possible (...)The lunch consisted of the following ingredients:cabbage - mullet - plums - zucchini - vanilla - beurre blanc - plaice - vadouvan - cardamom - endive - samphireAnd the result was a taste exploitation in our mouth, local flavours pure! Completed with a fine Pinot Noir Rosé sparkling wine as starter, from the south of the Netherlands and during the lunch itself, we had a delicious Pinot Noir Rosé from Austria.The service was excellent and informed us perfectly about the ingredients of each course.During good weather you can sit outside on the terrace with a beautiful view into their garden. And do not forget to take a walk through the garden after your lunch or dinner."
761620227,50,"July 26, 2020",AMAZING lunch,"I Went for an AMAZING lunch here with my family when they came to visit this week. I will be forever recommending this place to my friends and family and can not wait to go back. Everything from start to finish was spectacular, within 5 minutes of walking through the door we were sat at our table, in the beautiful greenhouse, with a glass of Dutch sparkling wine & our table was covered in plates of delicious, fresh snacks from the greenhouse. It only got better from there and every single wine pairing was perfect.They score perfect marks in every category here!"
759487444,50,"July 9, 2020",Wonderfull evening,"Very pleasant evening with overall good food some verging to the outstanding levels. Balanced and well priced wine list and friendly, attentive yet non-intrusive service. Recommended."

757391848,50,"June 14, 2020",Exquisite tastes and pure freshness,"I went there on 1 June for my birthday. The restaurant host was careful to ask us to use hand gel before entering and asked us about our health. I felt safe about its coronavirus measures.The tables inside were quite spaced out and we were greeted with an array of amuses bouches which were delicious. Every course after that was a delightful surprise and the way they combined the ingredients was very creative. The dishes all looked so beautiful they were like pieces of art.I loved the greenhouse as well where one could see the vegetables, herbs and edible flowers that would eventually be in your dishes."
757030613,50,"June 7, 2020",You're eating the best of the best fresh from the garden,"We chose this restaurant as THE ONE we wanted to go to as soon as social distancing regulations were lifted for eatings spots in the country. They have beautifully created space and ambiance that both feels safe and is equally beautiful. The food was divine, incredible, surprising, appealing and original. The service was A+."
750983252,50,"March 15, 2020",Would highly recommend!,We were recommended De Kas by a friend who comes to Amsterdam regularly and we were so glad we booked a table - lovely restaurant in a beautiful green house - great and friendly service and food was outstanding.We had oysters to start - Thai style - they were delicious!Mainly vegetarian with some fish and great wineMake sure you book in advance!
750160456,50,"March 9, 2020",We loved everything about it.,Six adults and a two year old enjoyed a leisurely lunch on a rainy weekday afternoon. The architecture was special to begin with and when you add the excellent service and world class food to the equation you’ve got something very special. The waitstaff made sure the toddler was entertained with little nibbles of this and that. And the adults were entertained with a thorough description of each unusual and delicious course. Top drawer experience top to bottom.
749552772,50,"March 6, 2020",Simply exquisite,"Amazing food, dining experience, extraordinary flavours and outstanding service. Highly recommended to book in advance. Can't go wrong."
748865871,50,"March 3, 2020",SUPER GREENHOUSE! SUPER FOOD! SUPER SERVICE,"We have been going to Amsterdam every February for around 10 years. 2020 was our last visit as the Exhibition at the RAI is moving to Barcelona in 2021. We wanted to do somethings we had not done before to make our last trip memorable. We had lunch at Restaurant De Kas. It was a good walk from our hotel and the weather was not ideal and we did get a little wet, but on arrival at De Kas we were welcomed warmly and our coats put to dry. The venue is fabulous, a large green house but nothing like a garden greenhouse. Super sleek solar panels, auto opening roof, sleek and elegant but not over stated, friendly service and the food, well that was brilliant. Modern twists, beautifully presented, super tastes and the price wasn't too bad at all for what we got. All 4 of us had a fabulous time there. Would love to go back in the Summer when there is more growing in the gardens. All the food is either from the garden (obviously limited in Feb) or from local organic growers. Really hit my foodie fancies this place did!"
748506837,50,"March 1, 2020",The best food we had in a month!,"We ate at de Kas a few days ago as we were flying home and had an evening in Amsterdam. Getting out of our Uber and seeing the glowing greenhouse out in the Park was beautiful! Are we in the right place??? Yes! The restaurant is beautiful, an old greenhouse refurbished with lovely glasswork hanging above and an exposed kitchen. A little of the produce is grown onsite, but most at their farm some distance away. The menu follows a tasting format and changes weekly to reflect what is coming in from the farm. Siegfried, our waiter, was a delight and we loved the way each course was explained to us. When our next course was ready, any of the wait staff would bring it out. Watching the kitchen from our table close by was a delight and a lesson in how hard the kitchen works and the dance of cooking staff to delivery of our courses to our table. The food was excellent and very creative, with dishes using ingredients which we had never seen together. Our waiter told us at the end of the night that the restaurant had just won “Best Organic Restaurant in Amsterdam”, beating out a Michelin three star for the third year in a row! Wow! It was a fantastic evening!"
748101149,50,"February 28, 2020","Stunning, locally sourced ingredients in a unique setting","We had the set lunch at De Kas and it was comfortably one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. All the ingredients are super fresh and put together by very talented chef's into creative, incredibly tasty dishes. The flavour they extract out of the veg and herbs grown on site is just increible. The staff are knowledgable, friendly and very attentive and the ambiance is just wonderful. The tables are set in a big atrium, with loads of natural light and a real feeling of spaciousness. We had such a great meal."
746724985,50,"February 22, 2020",Interesting and Innovative Food,"On our last 3 visits to Amsterdam, we have dined at De Kas -- that says something! And on this most recent trip, we were not disappointed. The dinner is pris fixe and while they respect food allergies or foods you don't eat, your choice is whether you want the 5-course meal or the 6-course meal. We selected the 5-course meal with wine pairings and it was wonderful. It was very tasty in different (but not outre) ways and you did not leave ""stuffed"". They grow most of their own herbs and vegetables (some you can see as you enter the restaurant) and source the rest of the food mainly from local farmers in the Netherlands. They are very respectful of the environment. The setting -- a large green house -- is lovely and comfortable, the food remains wonderful, and the service is very respectful. On our next trip to Amsterdam, we will go back -- of course!"

I like the fact that the restaurant is well lit because i like seeing clearly the food that i am eating, it is also spacious and its very cozy. We had the 6 course dinner and everything were perfect, its delicious and tasty. Everything was perfectly plated and interesting, there's this one dish that has salcify and i didn't even know what it was until now, all staffs were pleasant to us as well. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will be coming back soon!"
741353896,50,"January 26, 2020",Worth the bit of a trip,"Outside the central city, but worth the tram ride (line #19). Everything was perfectly balanced and perfectly tasty. They have their own greenhouse so you know everything is fresh. We ate here our last night and it was truly the culminating culinary experience of the trip."
738254917,50,"January 10, 2020",Amazing restaurant,We had lunch at De Kas restaurant.The restaurant located 15 minutes by car from the center.The food was amazing.

The cheese and the dessert were from out of this world.All ingredients are great quality, cooked to perfection and the flavours and textures are very crafted.The placer is not cheap, but in this case, I'm happy to pay the price because it is worthy if you enjoy good food."
736571361,50,"January 3, 2020","Healthy, regional and tasty","In this restaurant we had a wonderful menu for four persons and we really enjoyed this awesome dinner!The restaurant offers menus of their one vegetables and fruits and you can barely taste the freshness and the high quality of their own food.Our menu consists of five courses and every course had his own character and style. You can also order some cheese, which was great and they really tried to take care of allergens and other extra wishes.On top of that the room, in which we had the dinner, is really outstanding. The restaurant is a huge greenhouse, designers in a very stylish but elegant way.We also enjoyed the wonderful service with a charming waiter, who guided us trough the dinner and explained the food we had on our plates.Thanks for the wonderful evening and the impressive effort to offer healthy, regional and tasting food."
734939275,50,"December 27, 2019",Fantastic,"We took visitors here for lunch around the holidays and everyone loved their three-course meal, which was a great price for the excellent quality.

733060091,50,"December 16, 2019",Beautiful Dutch restaurant with their own produce,A restaurant located in a green house with delicious food. All dishes are made with their own produce or with ingredients from The Netherlands. The vegetarian option was super tasty. And the dessert was to die for! They just have tasting menus.
732901355,50,"December 15, 2019",Best Meal of the Vacation,This was everything you hoe for in field to table dining. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly and the food phenomenal. Small multi course plates served with style and bold flavors. If you are a foodie this is your stop. Great European wines that don't break the budget and a flight to match with courses available. Take time to dine here.

730132616,50,"December 1, 2019",Unique...truly farm to table....but slow service,"Overall, this was very good. The menu is literally a list of the ingredients they have from their garden to use in the 5 course pris fiixe meal. Beautiful restaurant...definitely worth it."
730070532,50,"December 1, 2019","Fresh & Local, Farm-to-Table, Innovative - A Great Culinary Experience","Traveling a great deal, we seek out the most innovative local cuisine and creative chefs everywhere. Everything about this place is amazing. It's a pre-fix, set menu. The setting is in a massive great house. Dining is elegant but very casual and comfortable. No need to dress up or act pretentious. No rush. Advance booking is necessary. It's a bit out of the way from the city center, but worth it. Uber can get you there and back in 15-20 minutes.The cuisine is always fresh and local, seasonal, responsibly sourced and presented as if it were fine art. Staff is charming and very helpful. Rarely see better."

This was a perfect choice.The restaurant has a wonderful ambience, sitting in a large glasshouse. We had the set menu which was predominantly vegetarian, with some excellent gluten free alternatives.The food was truly exceptional, with 80% grown locally. We would thoroughly recommend this restaurant as part of your next visit to Amsterdam."
728380014,40,"November 23, 2019","Interesting food, so tasty","We had dinner on a Wednesday evening. It's a lovely space, a bit big and impersonal, but really nice. The food was fresh and interesting. The service was great for 3/5 courses - but then the servers seemed to disappear. That didn't bother us at all,except we skipped a course and it took forever to get the bill."
727525226,50,"November 19, 2019","Extraordinary food, service","Extraordinary food, service and ambience. While complex, the presentations are straightforward and lacking in the pretensions so common in high end restaurants nowadays. Each dish was creative, unique and delicious. I have rarely been in such a spacious restaurant. Service was friendly and helpful. One of the most memorable dining experiences for the last several years of travel around the world."
725198096,50,"November 9, 2019",Just wow. Birthday to remember.,"This place is one of the best restaurants I’ve ever visited. Just wow - yes, it was that good. It was an experience - from the restaurant setting itself to the presentation of the food to the taste.Everything was outstanding. All dishes were just exquisite.My girlfriend had a birthday to remember and we will certainly visit this place again if we are ever back in Amsterdam.Highly recommended."
724344218,50,"November 5, 2019",Excellent food in a very interesting setting,"Every dish was surprising and fantastic. You have to be fairly open minded as they served dishes that I would never order in a restaurant but there were flavours that I’ve never had before, which really was amazing.I was a bit worried that the price of drinks was going to be extortionate but was pleasantly surprised when we got the bill as it was very reasonable.Would recommend to anyone and will defiantly be coming backThank you"
723766057,50,"November 4, 2019",Fresh vegetables picked yards from your table.,"If your looking for something different and out of the usual tourist places, this is just for you. The setting, inside a smart greenhouse on the edge of Frankendael Park, is just perfect to appreciate the creative, tasty and highly sensory courses that are served and described expertly by a friendly waitress.I would definitely go back."
722158344,50,"October 28, 2019",Excellent. Make a reservation.,"Farm-to-table restaurant. De Kas is a special place, located inside of a park. Using farm fresh ingredients this fixed menu is fantastic - creative plating, tasty courses, highly sensory. This is dining, not fast food. Expect to spend time here enjoying dinner conversation and the food you eat. If you have any allergies, let the restaurant know in advance. They will fully accommodate tastes and preferences."
721569660,10,"October 26, 2019",It’s not worth it,"Bad food, bad service. Don’t waste your time. Service was really slow we ate in 2 hours and a half and there was no dish worthy or exceptional"
720244884,50,"October 21, 2019",So Amazing - yet hard to describe,"One of the most unusual and yet wonderful restaurants I have ever dined in. The entire building is a green house where they grow many of their own vegetables and the rest is sourced from nearby farms. It's a priced fixed ""surprise"" menu so you do not know exactly what you will be served - and even after you have eaten it you may not be sure exactly what it was - but if you are adventurous and have a taste for the creative this is an experience you should not miss."
719128137,50,"October 17, 2019",Honeymoon Meal,"We booked dinner at this restaurant while we were in Amsterdam for our honeymoon. We had a great dining experience! They let you have a drink in one area before they sit you down. While you are having a drink, they bring out 3 plates prepared by the chef and we also got the fresh oysters. We then sat down and they had a cute pumpkin with a note from the staff wishing us a happy honeymoon. Such a sweet touch! We had the 5 course dinner and it was all so great! We had a lovely dining experience here.The weather when we went was raining and if you take a car, it drops you off outside the park, so you have about a 5 minute walk to the restaurant. That was the only downfall we faced!"
718367653,50,"October 14, 2019","Go for the experience, setting, service, food, the wine","The setting, the service, the food, the wine. Perfect from beginning to end. I was here for dinner with a group of 12 people and they had the perfect table in an alcove. Our waitress was helpful with the wine selections, each course was an adventure, and glad we went for the extra course, which was a second desert. The setting is unique, an updated greenhouse in a park with the main dining room in a large open space, a smaller room that I guess they reserve for private parties, and then the alcove we were seated in. The menu is prix fixe which I personally enjoy because you end up trying new things you may never order on your own. It adds to the excitement of the meal. Everything was beautifully plated. They did a good job catering to dietary restrictions. The wine suggestions were perfect. Our waitress was friendly and timely and was fun to be around. We also got to visit the actual greenhouse space where they grow veggies. Great for larger groups due to the space options and they ease of a prix fixe menu. My new favorite in Amsterdam."
717633958,50,"October 12, 2019",Great place,"Had a dinner with family, we a great time.The concept of the restaurant is to serve sets of menus, all food is prepared using only local seasonal vegetables, fish and meats. Microgreenery is being grown in the greenhouse next to the restaurant.Very spacious interior and very high ceiling, which make it easy to breathe while crowded.Food was really good, cooked with skill.Service was good.I totally recommend this restaurant-for lunch or dinner."
717194724,40,"October 10, 2019",Delicious and healthy food in a hot house,Had lunch here with friends in a weekday. Despite the bad weather the restaurant was full. The food was fantastic and healthy. Each dish was a work of art. I would gladly give this place a 5-star ranking if the prices went so high. The course lunch for 3 people with one drink per person was about €200.
715797316,50,"October 6, 2019",Outstanding,"De Kas was exceptional—both the quality of the food and the service were wonderful, but what made it exceptional was the space (an old greenhouse where all the trees in Amsterdam had been grown) and the type of food. It was largely vegetarian, but prepared with enormous attention to detail so that each bite (the food was carefully arranged on beautifully crafted plates and bowls) provided one with a new culinary sensation. If you like food, don’t miss this restaurant."
714035202,50,"September 29, 2019","Dramatic room, theatrical food, greenhouse","Loved de kas. Cab dropped us off at the corner of a park, it was very dark, and driver pointed us to pink lights through the trees - we walked across a bridge in the rain of course - all of a sudden this greenhouse appears and we entered the magical world of de kas. A tour through their growing things - tomatoes, beans, herbs etc. Then we entered the spectacular dining room - another high greenhouse structure with high ceilings and spacious tables. Earnest service. Interesting wine list. Chefs choice. Food had touches of Indonesian and other complex spices. And of course the freshest just picked veg. Of the five dishes two of ours had fish or meat. Then we had cheese and one dessert. Portions are small but i am ok with that - quality over quantity. Worth going out of your way. Special occasion."
713632066,50,"September 28, 2019",Great food in beautiful greenhouse setting,"This is a beautiful restaurant, tucked away in Amsterdam’s Frankendael park. They grow a lot of their own food in the greenhouse and source the rest from a local farm.You order a set menu of 5 or 6 courses. The 6th course is an extra dessert (which we skipped). Due to the many choices of vegetables, this is a good restaurant if you have a vegetarian in your group. Wine pairings (1/2 glass) were also very good.My main criticism would be the service. We opted to order oysters, which were delicious. However, we were not yet done eating them when they already brought the first course, so the timing was off. It also took forever to get the bill.But still, it was great and I would recommend it!"
713346476,50,"September 27, 2019",Experience & food - not to be missed.,This restaurant is set in a greenhouse which is an experience in itself. You can also go into where some of the food is grown too. The meal is a set menu however as my wife is coeliac they had meals especially prepared for her. Had a great night & a must do in Amsterdam.
713342081,50,"September 27, 2019",Wow! Amazing,"The food here is absolutely incredible, I was abit sceptical because of the lack of meat I’m not really a veggie person but it blew me away! Hands down some of the nicest food I’ve ever ate."
713196978,50,"September 26, 2019",Not to be missed,My husband and I ate here last night and absolutely loved it. I am pescatarian and he eats everything and they catered to both of our needs. Each dish was beautiful and a wonderful mix of flavors and textures.It was also very cool to eat inside a greenhouse and see where your vegetables are grown. The service was excellent as well.We took an Uber there and it was hard to find bc you have to walk into the park (not far) to enter the restaurant so just be prepared for that.
710053596,40,"September 15, 2019",Unique Experience,"Where else can you have dinner a spacious, airy former greenhouse? After reading all the great reviews, we booked De Kas for one of our three dinners in Amsterdam. The experience itself is unique and fun. Our Uber dropped us off at the park entrance and we wandered through the trees to find the restaurant glowing in the early evening light. Service was attentive but not overbearing, Saturday night atmosphere was lively but not too loud. Food was certainly inventive and interesting -- some of the combinations didn't quite work for me, but the care taken to showcase the ingredients was nice to see. Was it one of my most memorable meals ever? No, but the experience is one I will remember for many years."

707598513,50,"September 7, 2019",interesting presentation,"restaurant in a disused city greenhouse, great food, small plates, Indonesian and Dutch menu, local's dining, part of the greenhouse was still used by the chef to grow herbs and tomatoes. Look up at the tall chimney outside, storks are nesting there"
706036150,50,"September 3, 2019",Fabulous meal and beautiful setting,"We were in Europe for two weeks and decided this was the best dinner of our trip. The food is farm to table and very vegetable heavy. Every dish (pre fixed menu) had a beautiful presentation and was both unique and delicious. The servers did an excellent job explaining every dish. While not in the central Amsterdam area, it was a fast uber ride and well worth it."
703831842,50,"August 28, 2019",Tasting Menu & Kids Welcome!,"De Kas is an extraordinary simplistic tasting menu full of bounty from their own greenhouse. This wonderful restaurant is perfectly located in the beautiful park Huize Frankendael. Enjoy pre meal walk through the greenhouse and flower garden to see what is being harvested that day. You also get to see the honey bees hard at work! As you sit in the greenhouse restaurant (note: can be a bit warm) you can watch the blue herons landing in the weeping willow trees. This restaurant is welcoming of families and will prepare a kids plate and ask for a mocktail. The tasting menu is surprising and full of herbs and spices. Opt for the local Pinot Gris, it is delicious! The staff is on point and laid back."
703466308,40,"August 27, 2019",Fabulous food and setting,"Situated a little outside the centre. We took the train from the central station 1 stop and then walked. Trains very frequent. Restaurant is in a very large greenhouse that used to grow a lot of food for the city. Now converted into a very open and light space with a pond and in a larger park. Team grow all veg and source other food locally. There is a set menu and set price. You just chose the number of courses you want. Appetisers were followed by starter, fish course, main and two puddings. All dishes are exquisite as is the bread. We went for dinner which was €57 or 65. Good wine list and we went for the NL wine which was superb. With wine was just short of €200 in total. Would recommend as an experience."
702424682,50,"August 24, 2019",Heerlijk!,"What a great dinner, lots of surprises with great vegetables and perfect service. Definitely worth the money and i will go again when traveling to amsterdam. I do think that this is not the right restaurant for someone who wants to eat meat as the focus is on vegetables, as the name of the restaurant already suggests."

698312805,30,"August 12, 2019",Overrated,"Pros: very nice location, care in the detail, friendly service, cool concept of growing its own ingredients. The greenhouse is incredible, very peaceful also. Wide and interesting wine selection, I was happy with my wine.Cons: the dinner took too long, 2,5 hours for a 5 course menu with very small portions, too small. Tap water is unlimited if you pay 3,75€ per person....! The food was ok, sometimes there were some combination that I personally didn’t like. I had two courses with the same celery sauce that was ok for one course, not for two. One course was a tomatoes salad with some burrata on top - from my viewpoint something that I can easily do at home, I don’t go to restaurant for this. To be honest, I expected more, especially flavour-wise."
698242540,50,"August 12, 2019",Dreamy Atmosphere,A 20-minute metro ride from our hotel and we arrived at a Greenhouse in the middle of a field. Then we had one of the best dinners of our lives! We did the 6 course dinner menu with wine pairing. Each course was surprising and fresh and creative! We loved that they create a menu around what they grow. The atmosphere of this place was so wonderful too. Service was excellent--servers appeared before we even knew we needed anything and made great recommendations!
697888735,50,"August 11, 2019",All around a great experience,"The setting is amazing. It is industrial yet airy and feels like you yourself are actually picking the ingredients for each course. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient without rushing you at all. Each course was so exceptional that it was difficult for my friends and I to decide which we liked best. One of my friends ordered a cheese course after we thought we had finished the meal. She just wanted to keep going.A great experience all around"

695897037,40,"August 5, 2019",Bold flavor despite mainly vegetarian dishes,"We came for lunch on our last day of Amsterdam. Having had some great meals for the trip, we were expecting something different here with the TA reviews and yes that's exactly what we got.Not being a great vegetarian, I was most impressed with how bold the chef was working on the flavor of the dishes. I was expecting clean, simple, good for the body and eyes type of food but maybe lacking in flavors due to the veggie nature of the offering. But boy was I wrong. We had the 3 courses lunch menu and tried scallops, shrimps, grilled veggies and the amazing desserts. everything was cooked to perfection with unforgettable palette to the tongue. certainly nothing blend to speak of.The ambience and service are right up there with the food. we visited on a nice sunny day and it was just beautiful sitting outside the restaurant enjoying the garden and the surroundings with the great food.for those of you thinking twice about coming here because De Kas seems to be very veggie-oriented, don't think and just come. It's worth it, taking it from a meat-lover!"
694618123,50,"August 1, 2019",Amazing,"We made reservations here for dinner before we arrived in Amsterdam. De Kas came highly recommended by a friend of ours.De Kas is situated in a huge glass greenhouse in side of a park. We entered and were immediately greeted by the hostess who gave us a quick tour of the “greenhouse” section of the restaurant where they grow some of the produce that is used for the restaurant. She explained to us that the restaurant also has a farm which is separate from the restaurant property where they grow the rest of the produce used. We were seated immediately following the tour. Our server (all of them well dressed in G-Star denim) came to our table, introduced himself and explained the menu, which in addition to the 5,6 or 7 course tasting menu, include separate ala carte dishes. We opted for the tasting menu which starts at 5 courses and allows you the option to increase to 6 or 7 as you proceed with your meal, depending upon your appetite. They were also very accommodating to members in our group who had food allergies or simply did not like certain items in the menu. Every dish that was brought to the table was fully explained to us, including the “bread basket” and the amuse-bouche.This was by far, among the best restaurant experience I have had as it checked all of the boxes: great food, beautiful presentation, excellent service all in an amazing setting. I will definitely be back the next time I am in Amsterdam."
693900504,50,"July 29, 2019","Amazing, innovative, welcoming. You need to eat here!","De Kas is situated in a beautiful park, in a gorgeous greenhouse setting. The hostess explained that they use all of the produce they grow, both at the restaurant and at another nursery close by. The setting is beautiful. The service is attentive, professional and warm. And, the food is as gorgeous as it is delicious. One of my friends has many food preferences, and they were able to provide alternatives to all of his requests. Our server, Jasper, was the best! This was one of our highlights of Amsterdam."
692815255,50,"July 26, 2019",One of the best meals I've had,"We went earlier in the year while on holiday and had an amazing dinner. The food and service were amazing, explaining through the meal as we went (In English which was greatly appreciated). The space was beautiful, and was a nice temperature considering you're eating in what appears a huge greenhouse.Never had such good Gnocchi, and their Soya Beurre Blanc foam was one of the nicest thing I have ever eaten.If we ever come back to Amsterdam we will definitely go back here to eat."

I spent 3 hours waiting for 4 salads and 1 chicken wing. Then we were given the option of cheese or cheese and dessert. I could not wait to leave. Maybe if you are a vegetarian and don’t mind spending 80 euros pp with wine this is for you. There is a good reason very few of the other reviews mention what food they actually ate."
686116701,50,"July 2, 2019",Best restaurant !,"To me, the best restaurant I have been. It is an experience going here. The Menu is definitely creative. It can get any fresher than produce from the greenhouse steps away from your table. Delicious. I'm vegetarian so it was heaven for me. They also accommodate for vegans and my husband's menu included a fish since he eats meat. He is not a fan of vegetables (at all) and even he had a great meal. Go!"

Service was great! Can’t get more farm to table then this. Your dining in a huge green house!"
683809069,50,"June 23, 2019",A fantastic dining experience,"Just the setting alone of this restaurant is fantastic. It is a large greenhouse, set in a lovely park, where they not only delight guests with their food, but also grow most of their own ingredients. The food is really a whole experience in itself and the service is great. They offer a fixed menu which is changed each week, presumably based on what is in season, and each course is a journey."
683366530,50,"June 22, 2019",Outstanding,"My wife and I ate at de Kas a few nights ago. The entire experience was outstanding. The food was superb. Very fresh, seasonal, and creative.

682338119,50,"June 17, 2019",Perfection!,"My fiancé and I had a truly wonderful experience at this restaurant. The staff couldn’t do enough to help and were very friendly and passionate about what they do.

Really something I couldn’t recommend enough if you like fresh, inventive and ultimately delicious food and wine."
681008874,50,"June 12, 2019",Amazing!,"I would highly recommend De Kas. The food and service is fantastic. It's not an everyday restaurant, for a special occasion it really is lovely. I will go back in the future."
679285530,40,"June 5, 2019","I loved it, the husband...not as much","My husband and I went here for lunch on a rainy June day for lunch. I’m vegan and he’s not. This restaurant really is about the vegetables-so I was in heaven. All of my 3 dishes were extremely tasteful, well balanced and visually very attractive. I think the nuances in the seasoning and the use of herbs and spices definitely appeal to a discerning diner. The setting is bright, light and airy.My husband found the food boring and over priced. He thought the setting lacked warmth and ambiance. I found myself wishing I was sitting at one of the neighboring tables with the other like minded people.So...if you’ve got a sophisticated palette and don’t mind spending some cash on a great meal, go for it! I really enjoyed it."
679152595,50,"June 5, 2019",Unpretentious Fine Dining,We were treated by our daughter to this fine experience. De Kas prides itself in serving food prepared from fully sustainable sources and produced on site or nearby in their own farms. There is no menu just a list of the ingredients used by the talented and creative chefs to make each course which is then described by your waiter. A night at De Kas is fine dining in that pragmatic and unpretentious Dutch way.
678562332,40,"June 3, 2019",Fresh-tasting,"De Kas in the largest of several greenhouses and the tables are arranged inside. Despite the hard glass surfaces the noise level was not too bad when the restaurant was full.Many of the ingredients are grown in the greenhouses or at a plot just outside Amsterdam so the menu is very seasonal. In May there were a lot of green leaves!We chose the five dish tasting menu (57€)▪ Tapioca and mustard seed crisp with a celery dip▪ amuse bouche 1: pak choy and green oil sauce▪ amuse bouche 2: baby turnip with mustard seed and piccalilli sauce▪ amuse bouche 3: spring rolls stuffed with lettuce and ginger▪ beetroot gazpacho with mint and Greek basil and Buratta cheese▪ beurre blanc sauce with trout eggs and tobiko eggs with roast lettuce, samphire and oyster leaf▪ roast cauliflower on Mexican mole sauce with green tomato sauce▪ corn taco and cauliflower pieces, corn, nasturtium and dill▪ poulet noir, yellow pepper and pickled onion and cheese sauce▪ strawberry, rhubarb, violet lemon sorbet, pansy flowers and meringueOverall a very well-presented, fresh-tasting and enjoyable dinner.

676216539,50,"May 24, 2019",dinner in an extraordinary place,"This restaurant differs from any other that I have visited. It was a theatrical experience. The food was delicious and artistically served. One eats in a restored greenhouse in a pleasant park in a suburb of Amsterdam. You don’t get a menu; just a list of ingredients they are proposing to serve that day. The basic menu is four or five courses. They serve four courses and then ask whether you would like some more dishes and you can discuss the options with the waiting staff. We stopped at four then chose a cheese plater to share and then went back to a fifth course, fruit and mint sorbet.The restaurant prides itself that all the vegetables it serves have been picked that very day. It is not a vegetarian restaurant but the focus of most of the dishes is vegetables or fruit served with interesting sauces. There were fish eggs in one dish and one chicken course; although this was my least favourite of the evening as I thought the chicken had a bland taste. I loved every moment. My wife thought the food was excellent but said she was not satisfied by the meal. I am still trying to work out what she means!The servers are young and friendly and passionate about the restaurant’s mission. Good wine list and plenty of choice of wines by the glass."
675949885,50,"May 23, 2019",Didn't Want this Meal to End,"Friends recommended we make a reservation, so we did and from the moment we arrived we were so pleased. Each course was more delicious than the next. Unique flavors and textures that were surprising and delicious. Would highly recommend."
675780506,50,"May 22, 2019",We loved it!,"This place is far from the city center and is possibly not on the tourist maps. But it is still worth a visit!When I was invited to lunch at De Kas, I was rather sceptical - I am not the biggest fan of the ""close to nature, far from urban town"" lunches. Gosh, I was wrong!The creativity of the chef, who turns the veregtables they are growing next to the place into the amazing meal, is outstanding. Even being the grumpiest person in the world, you could never hide your excitement of every bite.Another suprise I got there was their wine list. They stay away from traditional choices and offer you a lot of interesting choices you would probably ignore at your usual dinner. I especially recommened to try their choice of Dutch white wines.Service is super friendly. Surroundings (with the garden around, etc.) are amazing.I don't care much for this location in the evening, but i found this place a perfect venue for the lunches."
675721175,50,"May 22, 2019",Outstanding,"Absolutely perfect meal. The location is just breath taking, which makes the experience even better. But the food, just makes a trip to Amsterdam worth it just to pay a visit to this wonderful restaurant. Every dish is a surprise, you don’t get a menu, just a list of ingredients that you will meet at some point during the meal. Nothing is obvious and every bite makes you close your eyes and take in eeeevery flavour of the dish. Absolutely amazing!"
675484915,50,"May 21, 2019",Excellent,What a fabulous location. Would thoroughly recommend. Food delicious and a very unusual setting. They bring you a menu of several small plates which were all exquisite. The service was professional and friendly and we can not wait to go back. I would not miss meat with this beautiful food. The bread was fresh but so moreish I filled myself up so fast. If in Amsterdam try and visit. Be prepared to spend but we thought worth it.
675399805,50,"May 21, 2019","Gorgeous setting, impressive service and delightful food and wine.","Why not dine in a greenhouse particularly if the food is excellent and the highly trained staff moves about as a precision drill team. In spite of the large open surroundings the setting is remarkably quiet, suitable for a couple or group.Our five course meal began with a special ""amuse bouche"" (course zero) followed by local oysters and both courses were excellent. We chose the wine pairing with wines from Netherlands, Spain and Italy that fit the courses well.Course one consisted of beet root gazpacho, burrata, basil and radish. The beets were creamy and mated well with the burrata.Following were course two with butter head lettuce, oyster leaf, samphire, tobiko eggs and beurre blanc, course three with cauliflower taco mole, tomato salsa and chervil sauce, course four black leg chicken with aji amarillo and wild garlic and dessert consisting of rhubarb, lemon sorbet, verbena, meringue and vanilla.All were bowl licking good.Dining at De Kas was the perfect way to end a visit to Amsterdam."
675372036,40,"May 20, 2019",Different,"I was a bit apprehensive about De Kas however, upon arrival I fell in love with the venue, a large glas green house set in a lovely suburban park.The food is eclectic, based very much in plant combinations coupled with small amounts of fish or meat in some dishes.Portions are small but the addition of bread, some amuse Bouche to begin will fill your stomach"
674988342,50,"May 19, 2019",Fantastic food and experience,"You dine at the inside of a greenhouse. The menu consists of seasonal groceries and is very well composed. Well worth a visit. Make a reservation in advance - if it's fully booked for dinner, lunch is absolutely worth a try, too."

Walking through the park to get to this beautiful restaurant was a nice way to start. The food was delicious and everyone we interacted with was friendly. This is an experience - make sure you give yourself at least 3 hours here.
674685433,50,"May 17, 2019",Stunningly Unique & Delicious,"Each course was a new taste sensation and delight! Each course was really a piece of art. It is said one eats first with their eyes, this shall not disappoint! The chef(s) have a creative flair with flavor too, pairing the traditional menu item with unexpected but delightful nuances. Really an outstanding dining experience. One cannot have this great a food adventure without an educated staff. An evening to remember, without hesitation! (The dining room was quite loud, but should not be a deterrent.) One does not choose from a menu here, rather one eats what is being served that evening, unless restricted by allergies, as I am. They make the needed changes accordingly."
674564088,50,"May 17, 2019",Gastronomic and organic,"The restaurant (de Kas = the greenhouse) is located in the former municipal greenhouses of Amsterdam, out of the center but easy to reach by tram 19. It is located in a park and we cross ducks as we walk 100 meters from the street.The welcome and the service are very pleasant, young and professional. We take the aperitif (a local De Prael beer and a glass of sauvignon) in the beautiful conservatory, after having crossed a greenhouse where are cultivated vegetables served in the restaurant.There are one big and two smaller private rooms, and the main room is very beautiful, with nice big glass chandeliers in changing colors from blue to green.We are presented with the list of ingredients that make up the menu, which is a surprise, with 5 or 6 dishes (to be decided after the main course).We enjoy an excellent tasting, a real treat for the taste buds:* Rice crackers with celery sauce* Potato in an onion broth* Turnip, piccalilli sauce and poppy seeds* Spring roll with lettuce and ginger, sesame sauce with sesame seeds* Beetroot gaspacho, beetroot, onion and Puglia burrata* Oyster leaf, lettuce and samphire, white butter with trout eggs and tobiko (Japanese flying fish eggs)* Roast cauliflower, mole sauce (Mexican sauce with chilli, chocolate, sesame, peanut, tomato, fried and crumbled tortilla), mini tacos with cauliflower* Black chicken breast, wild garlic and toasted chicken skin(it's the main course, and we choose to take 5 courses)* Lemon sorbet, violet sorbet, panna cotta, strawberries, rhubarb and meringueWe followed the advice of our lovely waitress and chose an organic Sancerre from François Crochet.An excellent dinner, with a 190€ bill (of which 57,50€ for the wine).Booking is highly recommended for dinner."

We all commented that we’ve never tasted anything quite as fresh, creative and ‘eatable’ as this meal. Just fabulous. Brilliant but small wine menu - waiters very happy for us to try several wines before we settled on a favourite. Do yourself a favour and spend a few hours in this amazing place.

All 5 of the dishes on the menu were amazing (who knew a baby turnip with mustard dressing would be really nice??), my girlfriend had the vegetarian options which they are happy to do for you on the day and are equally as good! Just realised I also forgot the fresh bread at the start, as expected... also fantastic. Because it was her birthday they were kind enough to give us a fresh jar of honey from their bee hives and a lovely dessert for free"
667853530,40,"April 20, 2019",High expectations were not met,"De Kas had been recommended by several friends and we were looking forward to celebrating our last night in Amsterdam at this establishment.We got there early and walked the grounds and greenhouse and visited the park behind the restaurant.The 'Library' is located through the greenhouse and all the windows makes it warm and inviting. This initial experience was PERFECTION as the setting, amuse-bouche and cocktails were delightful and these ended up being the best part of our evening.We were seated in the middle of the room, which was OK because it wasn't too crowded, but if you want a more intimate setting, request to be seated against the wall/window.The main courses were good, but one was on the tasteless side (first course) and the ingredients in a couple seemed to be competing for attention.We selected their 5-course ($57e/pp) because by the time we need to decide on a 5 or 6-course dinner, we were getting full.Our wine was $60e and by the end of the dinner, our bill came into over $300USD. Not sure how it got so expensive and at the time, didn't scrutinize the bill.The main entree, lamb, served two ways and wasn't overwhelming and our least favorite dish..My favorites were the Morels with a soft yolk, Kohlrabi with shrimp and yellow curry coconut bisque, and Celeriac with mackerel broth.Service was inconsistent with different wait-staff delivering various dishes.Overall, the service, a couple of inconsistent dishes, and the expense kept this from being 5-star.De Kas does have it's own greenhouse and garden onsite and the edible flowers were on almost every dish. They also have a large field about 6 miles from Amsterdam where they grow seasonal vegetables. What they don't grow, they sources from local farmers."
667716030,40,"April 19, 2019",Hit and Miss in a Stunning Setting,"Don’t let the title deter you from making a reservation. This is worthy of the trek to the outskirts of the city to experience the room and the environs. I went with my niece, who does not love seafood, which was the star of the lunch tasting menu. They created a vegetarian menu for her, using super fresh, locally grown ingredients. Many grown right there. Both of us liked elements of each dish but few of them really worked. Flavors competed or fell flat. The bread was great though we did not care for the celery mayonnaise it was served with. We loved the prawn dish, the opener for the tasting menu, and also liked the basil/celery soup. The other dishes used fresh fish and vegetables but did not speak to us. Presentations were outstanding as was the service. I thought it was well worth the $35 euros pp. Make a reservation. Dinner is more courses and a bit more money. I will try it when I’m next in Amsterdam."
667604620,50,"April 19, 2019",Amazing meal in a beautiful setting,"The setting in this restaurant in the evening was was just beautiful! It was a bit further out from where we were staying, but well worth the easy tram ride to get there. While not vegetarian, vegetables were the main focus on the menu. The courses were very creative and beautifully presented. The food and service were outstanding."
665409877,20,"April 10, 2019",Disappointed,"De Kas dining experience, though started well, having been served one of the best sourdough bread I’ve ever had, has started to quickly deflate towards the end and left me completely disappointed. The dishes were not well balanced and the ingredients used did not complement each other, creating some unpleasant taste palettes.Despite giving some feedback to the members of staff, there was no action from their side, not something you would expect from a restaurant this level.A note though, their menu changes depending on their harvest, so you might be luckier and have a nicer dining experience, once their menu options change."
664086813,50,"April 5, 2019",Eco friendly gourmet restaurant!,"Well worth the effort to get here even in terrible weather, it was a great experience with interesting combinations made with ultra fresh produce. Friendly service in a relaxed atmosphere. Would love to come back in the summertime..."
662980266,50,"April 1, 2019",Exquisite...,"April, 8pm pre-booked in an historical greenhouse a taxi ride from the hotel. Sustainable, organic food once grown around the greenhouse now outside the city. The menu is set and changes weekly there is wine pairing and option for more than 5 courses which sounds alot but each dish is no more than 4 mouthfuls of exquisite flavour which for me, was beyond joy to explore. Space between courses is timed, a range of crockery to present and an army of informed waiting staff to explain the dish and take your dietry needs into consideration. Beautiful atmosphere of happy chatter, under giant jellyfish lights and 3 hours later left feeling so satisfied that every clever detail of cheffing had been part of it. Would go back in Summer season to rediscover. Recommended without a doubt. Well done De Kas"

The place is super nice with lots of plants and with a special atmosphere. It is located in side a park, so I decided to go for lunch. I went there by rented bike, it took me about 15 minutes from downtown.Although I didn’t have reservation, I highly recommend you doing. It is a set menu and all prices are on the website. I order the 3 meal course, sparkling water and a coffee and país E$44. Totally worth it!The food was good, with different ingredientes and beautifully prepared. They were kind to adapt the menu for my food restriction. Staff is amazing!The best of the restaurant is truly the space! Would go back!"

657101847,50,"March 7, 2019",PERFECTION - farm to table food with atmosphere,"I really can’t remember enjoying a restaurant experience more. You arrive at the edge of a small park and can see the pink lights of a greenhouse through the trees. Inside, they are cultivating fruit and vegetables and you are led into the beautiful spacious restaurant area within the greenhouse. It’s light and modern, with contemporary light fittings and simple furniture that only the Dutch do so well. The wooden tables are spaced far from one another to allow for a discreet and calm experience. Despite concrete floor and glass and metal roof, the acoustics are excellent and add to the calm. The staff are charming, efficient, knowledgeable and passionate about the food. De Kas offers an incredible tasting menu of in-season foods, with some ingredients grown under their roof. There is an option of oysters and a couple of small tasters even before the tasting begins. Each of the 5-6 courses was a delicious and delicate artistically presented experience.You never want it to end. The service was exceptional, with the courses perfectly choreographed to arrive one after another without feeling rushed. At €57 for a 5-course tasting menu, it’s good value. They also do optional wine pairings. Wow! Wow! Wow! It's a hard act to follow. De Kas please come to a London park."
656763252,50,"March 6, 2019",Exceptional,"Absolutely loved the whole experience at De Kas.We have eaten at many great restaurants around the world, many Michelin starred, however this tops the lot for me. The food and service is first class. The attentiveness from the wait staff is spot onThe story of the food is great and they bring to life some random things you would never think to eat. All the food was cooked perfectly and the flavours were amazing The mackerel dish was the highlight.Thank you De Kas!"
656276496,50,"March 4, 2019",A place you must visit,We had a wondeful dinner and night in this restaurant. Every course was an incredible tasting experience. The flavors blend together with perfect harmony and the atmosphere is a must for a great dinner. Eating in a beautiful greenhouse is priceless.
655840451,50,"March 2, 2019",Unique experience and delicious food,"The experience was just wonderful.The staff were so friendly and spoke brilliant English and helped us understand how it all worked. We went with the most basic - a 3 course lunch and paired it with a wine of our choice. The price was so reasonable given that it is not designed to be a cheap grab and go lunch. As two very greedy individuals we were concerned that the portion size was going to be far too small but pleasantly surprised. The food was just incredible. If you're fussy I don't recommend as it is an entirely fixed menu, the food was vegan/clean/organic. I originally thought there wasn't any meat but there was a few hints of it - which was great. All in all the most exciting experience we loved it :)"

653611063,50,"February 19, 2019",WOW! what a great place with gorgeous amazing food!,We booked this as a lunch one day as we were staying in Hotel V Fizeaustraat near by. Looked like somewhere we would enjoy but it far exceeded expectations and left us wanting to go back! The setting is utterly beautiful and light filled but warm and inviting feeling and the staff were simply great and knowledgeable. The food is utterly delicious and well balanced and perfect portion sizes considering we choose the 3 course menu and had some appetisers brought to us to get us going too. Really we were blown away with the care and attention to taste and detail which clearly goes into creating such wonderful food. I consider myself lucky to have found this place in our city break and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
652825056,30,"February 16, 2019",It’s a snack place not a restaurant !,It’s so nice to find such a clever idea turning a greenhouse to a restaurant in the outskirts of Amsterdam! Very romantic and well presented ! I don’t know of course if it is true that all the veggies are from their garden and they are organic or not ....!the taste of all the dishes of four or five fixed courses menu was very interesting but so little that it’s hard to tell ! The most tasteful of all are the complimentary dishes at the begging if you order some drinks before sit at the table ! The other thing was the slow rhythm of serving the food ... maybe they think that eating slowly you are easily get full with less food ! Any way if they want to stay in business they should change the little food idea ! Of course it’s an expensive restaurant considering that you need to go somewhere else to have a decent dinner as well !
650400934,30,"February 5, 2019",Sauce after sauce after sauce after sauce,"Let me start by saying that staff and facilities are really good. Staff well educated, attentive and a pleasure to be served by.The food was perfectly prepared, of high quality and super innovative.But and it is a big but!The veggie menu was so off the mark in taste and balance. Two dishes were straight forward fail tasting - here there was no innovation or pleasure.The normal menu was so one sided - sauce with greenery - to the extend it was difficult to tell the difference. The taste buds were exposed to one chock after the other but it was less refined and varied than expected. It seemed that the intended effect was taste explosions and not new interesting taste combinations.This must be placed in comparison with the prices which are way too higher for what is being served - €300 for 3 people and 2 wine menus.We will not go back!"
650169063,50,"February 4, 2019",Fabulous Flavors,Excellent farm to table preparations. 5 course fixed menu with all excellent dishes and interesting flavors. Wine pairings with Dutch and other European wines are well chosen. Way out of town but accessible via a short Metro ride followed by a ride on the 19 tram. About 30 min from Central. Located in a greenhouse in a park. Spectacular.
648581309,50,"January 27, 2019",Birthday meal for my partner,"Picked this restaurant for the birthday visit from England with my partner. Niether of us eat meat and De Kas was very accommodating and made us a special taster menu. The setting of the restaurant is beautiful, the staff were friendly and attentive. Each dish that came was more delicious than the last. Before going to this place if you told me i would love jerusalem artichoke sorbet, i would have laughed, but i did love it. On the whole it was a real treat. I hope to be back."

647084013,50,"January 19, 2019",Unique Place! Delicious food!,"De Kas is a garden conservatory restaurant located in Park Frankendael.The place is quite unique: it’s a huge greenhouse inside the park. Inside they have a spacious dining room, a garden room for private hiring and a smaller greenhouse in which they grow most of the ingredients.My friend and I went for lunch on a sunny day and it was truly beautiful. I would strongly suggest trying it out if planning to visit Amsterdam. Perfect for a date!I would also recommend booking in advance as it is not very easy to get a reservation.In terms of food, it was delicious. The menu changes on a weekly basis, therefore I cannot suggest any dishes but it was incredibly tasty.All the dishes are built around sustainably grown vegetables produced either on site or in other greenhouses the brand owns outside Amsterdam.Overall it was a great experience, and I would definitely go back and try new dishes."

644406156,50,"January 7, 2019",Something different!,"If you want to try something different in Amsterdam, you should visit De Kas restaurant. Although I am not a vegeterian nor vegan, I enjoyed the fresh colourful dishes! It was a surprise for me! The only dish I didn't enjoyed as much as the rest dishes was the pointed cabbage because it had too much curry for me. The wine was also great! You can also have a walk to Park Frankendael which is right next to De Kas.Definitely recommended!"
643931637,20,"January 5, 2019","Space beautiful, food horrendous","The menu was all vegetarian, fine by me as I’m a pescatarian, my partner isn’t so he was disappointed off the bat.My favourite cook is Ottolenghi so I was excited to see what this restaurant could do with vegetables.Short review, portions were pretty and extraordinarily small, bad flavours I.e leek cooked within an inch of its life with a curry sauce that belongs in a curry sausages flavour packet from the supermarket.We left hungry and 110 euro poorer (we didn’t drink any wine) for three courses that were edible. We sent plates full back to the kitchen and no one said anything.If you’re Australian don’t go, our veggies and paddock to plate philosophy and how we serve them are far more interesting, cheaper and satisfying.But if you do go - there are apples in a big bowl that you can take on the way out incase you’re hungry!"
641478365,50,"December 25, 2018",Amazing farm to table experience,This might be one of the most amazing dining experiences in my life .. the menu was fixed the day we visited 12/22Being a vegetarian they customized the courses for me ..Each and every ingredient is sourced locally or grown in their own farm and one can taste every thing on the plateSet aside 2-3 hrs for a full experience and you will not be disappointedPricey .. but totally worth the money

From the first moment you see the glass building, you are intrigued, and once you step inside, you feel like you are in a fairytale. You walk past the greenhouse with ceiling-high tomatoes, micro herbs & all other growing beauties. Once sat down, we were delighted to hear about the range of food, chosen daily based on the yield from their gardens. Myself & my partner were delighted to enjoy every course, one of which was vegetarian. This restaurant hit the nail perfectly in every aspect, including a great wine list. After dinner, we wandered into the greenhouse where I was proposed too which topped off the best evening of food either of us have ever had. Highly recommend this beautiful place!"

We had a glass of champagne to start and a delicious Assuli Grillo, Italina wine with our meal.The waiters/resses rotate around the tables, each chatting about the course they are serving. A special and memorable evening."

Walk over a bridge and into a park-like setting where you will be dining inside of a greenhouse, alongside where most of your meal has been grown. The flavor combinations here will blow your mind, as will the presentation and warm service. Also, they have many excellent wines to accompany this very special meal. The atmosphere is unlike anything else in Amsterdam."

I feel kinda dorky saying that..I’d laugh at myself for describing it that way...but it truly was! My taste buds exploded with each bite- the textures, the ingredients, the smells! Even the bread was divine! Some may say each course was small, but I was sufficiently full by the end of the meal (& I am used to NJ diner portions!). If you’re going to be in Amsterdam, def go!

A beautiful venue ever so slightly out of central Amsterdam . A lovingly rebuilt greenhouse transformed into a serene and gorgeous restaurant. An actual in house on site greenhouse grows many of the vegetables served in such innovative and delicious courses. The menu is primarily vegetarian. There is always a fish, chicken or meat course. Starters are fantastic and simply part of the journey. Choose either a 5 or 6 course menu and plan on at least two hours. Start with a local gin and tonic or blanc de blanc in the garden room. We did! How I loved the house made breads with dough fermented for not 24 but 26 hours. Experience pumpkin ceviche or maybe chanterelles with a soft poached egg yolk. Service is relaxed but highly experienced and done with an easy smile. Plaice served with Jerusalem artichokes was sublime. Share a cheese platter or move onto dessert. Remember to reserve up to 90 days prior to your visit and plan on coming back, as we hope to!"
623403139,50,"October 9, 2018",Wow!,"A six course dinner experience. This is a true farm to table restaurant. Located in a greenhouse setting, complete with their own small farm, and sourcing vegetables and meats from other nearby farms, the dishes were varied, original, uniquely seasoned and prepared just right. Open up your mind to whatever they serve and enjoy. This is a fixed menu so if you are a picky eater this is probably not for you. I tend to be picky but decided to suspend that tendency of mine for a night and was well rewarded. Each dish is on the small side, but altogether you will have plenty to eat. This is a dining experience which is not rushed. We were there for almost 3 hours. If you have any food allergies they will accommodate you.The bottom line, this was one of the finest dining experiences I've had the pleasure of experiencing. Good jeans and a collared shirt are fine."

617981887,50,"September 19, 2018","Unusual, enchanting, delicious.","First, a word of warning. This greenhouse restaurant in the middle of a city park is very popular. So, book in advance. In our world of too many choices, de Kas is a delightful exception. We went for lunch (which I recommend, because the view of the gardens right outside is well worth it), and they asked one question: ""Do you want the vegetarian lunch?"" Once it was settled that we were meat eaters, they brought us four courses, not including dessert. Everything was inspired and delicious, The service was courteous, but not intrusive. This is a wonderful place to visit. Arrive hungry. Sit by the window for people watching. The characters who strolled along on the path outside were part of the delightful experience."
615948092,50,"September 12, 2018",Greenhouse with great food and ambiance,"Why this place is only rated as number 80 of restaurants in Amsterdam is strange in my opinion. It’s definitely on my “top 10 restaurants around the world”De Kas is an unusual place with a set menu where you can choose between a 4-5 or 6 courses. We had a wonderful dinner and I can truly recommend this place to everyone. The service is so right and when the food tastes like heaven too, it’s a winner to me. The bill for 2 of us and a bottle of wine was 170 € and for a Norwegian like me that’s a bargain. Will for sure visit again next time I’m in Amsterdam."
615927420,50,"September 12, 2018",Eating in a greenhouse,"Great vegan option. How could it fail, eating in a greenhouse is both beautiful and unique. A tasting menu with options of 4-6 courses and paired wines. The waiter was both informative and attentive. A decent walk or uber from the central canal area but worth the effort."
613044095,50,"September 1, 2018",Wonderful experience,"I've dined at De Kas on a couple of occasions for lunch and diner and it is undoubtedly an experience not to be missed, hence I'm very much looking forward to my next visit, (already booked).I recommended De Kas to a friend who immediately wanted to read the reviews, which are obviously overwhelmingly, and rightly so, positive. However, one thing we both found odd is that those reviews which raised negatives are by enlarge ignored by the De Kas team, and do not receive a response. Personally, I think negative reviews deserve more attention that positive reviews, you are already aware of what is great about your restaurant. Those making negative (constructive) points deserve a response too.I know this is a minor point, but when everything else is perfect, seems ashame not to address this.David"
611251806,40,"August 27, 2018",Enjoyable!,"Personally, I'm not that into vegetarian / pescatarian dishes, but I went to De Kas for the sake of my friends who love this sort of thing (and to be fair, De Kas is not specifically a vegetarian / pescatarian restaurant, it's just that the menu usually turns out this way if you only source locally?).To my surprise, I really enjoyed the food they served. They were creative with the flavors they used. In particular, they had a dish with miso and fennel which I liked. I'm not a fan of the flower petals being added on all the dishes, but that's neither here nor there since I had a great time at the end of the day! (and did I mention the restaurant is located in a greenhouse? The ambiance was cool!)"

Do not come to eat that much: you have to taste everything but you won't have tons of food.About 50 euros pp, drinks included, book in advance and close your eyes!"
609785342,50,"August 24, 2018",We loved this beautiful greenhouse restaurant in a park!,I had read about this place before we arrived in Amsterdam and couldn't wait to try it. We enjoyed the change of scenery and walked in the greenhouse garden. Four of us had the tasting menu and two lovely bottles of wine. Would definitely recommend!
609781354,50,"August 24, 2018",Best meal in Amsterdam,"We went to De Kas for our anniversary and were so please with EVERYTHING!!! The service is excellent and every employees were helpful and dedicated, they even showed us around the greenhouse and recommended other places to eat during our stay in The Netherlands. The food was simply incredible, every ingredient was fresh and perfectly executed, we loved every course, the oysters were fantastic and the amuse bouche so creative! The restaurant itself is incredibly beautiful, the main greenhouse were we seated was spectacular and the ambiance was perfect. Truly an amazing experience on every aspect!!"
609499216,50,"August 23, 2018",Hard to fault,"We have been going to De Kas for several years now and have always found it an excellent treat. The food is healthy and delicious, the plates with the sumptuously looking food are brought to you by very friendly waiters. The desserts are simply sublime. The setting is nothing less than spectacular; the restaurant being located in a large greenhouse surrounded by trees, herbs and vegetable plots. And don’t forget a short visit to their vegetable garden on the way out before you pick up one of their juicy organic apples at the door."
607590723,40,"August 18, 2018",Veggie heaven,"If you like veggie, this is the place to go. All kinds of self-grown vegetables are being served. Which is nice...if you are a veggie. A very small selection of meat, namely one dish with pork. But I do have to say, it was all tasteful..."
606647823,40,"August 15, 2018",Great connection food but pricey,This restaurant had a lot of atmosphere and we enjoyed the concept of eating seasonal produce only from what was grown in the gardens. The outdoors was laid out in parterre gardens which were neatly organised.The food was very pricey and some flavour combinations did not work eg asparagus with curry sauce as curry was far too over powering. It was a pleasant evening.
605658806,50,"August 12, 2018",Exceptional Experience - discovering vegetables like never before.,"The concept is simple: local, fresh, innovative and exceptionally tasty.There is no menu - by indicating dietary restrictions you can trust that the chefs will take you on culinary experience filled with surprising flavour combinations that you’ve never tasted before.De Kas brings the attention back to vegetables which are prepared in a way to satisfy the hunger of even the biggest carnivores. But not to worry ... the main course always includes a type of meat according to seasonal availability and dietary preferences.Food aside, the restaurant is build in an old green house - the tomatoes that you eat are literarily grown 5-10 meters away from your table. Surrounded by glass, wood, plants and a 360 degree view of the sky “de Kas” creates an unforgettable dining experience.For haute cuisine food the pricing is surprisingly fair, expect to pay somewhere between 50-60 Euro per person excluding drinks.The perfect restaurant for a special occasion, to celebrate, to be surprised and to make your taste buds dance."
604770797,50,"August 9, 2018",5-steps-to-heaven menu,"we had a wonderful time at the restaurant and have never experienced anything as tasty as the menue we were able to enjoy here. It really was a 5-steps-to-heaven meal with all the different fresh herbs, vegetables and spices. Also a vegetarian version of the menu was no problem at all and the staff was super friendly.It may be a bit more pricy than other places, but just keep in mind, that all the vegetable ingredients are grown right there and are therefore as fresh as they can be. And you can taste this, so it is really worth every penny!If there is one negative point to it, I'd have to mention that the air conditioning made this place quite chilly. It was however a super hot day when we visited, so maybe this is not the usual temperature. Just bring a jacket and you will be fine, but don't miss this culinary highlight!"
604373928,40,"August 8, 2018",Modern fusion,"We had a small dégustation lunch with 3 dishes for €32.50 with option for oyster starter at €3.50 each. We had deep fried tapioca crackers with green parsley dip and two amuse bouche for appetizer with clean tomato salad with verbena sorbet for the first dish. Green beans with fenugreek curry and goat’s yoghurt was a second dish. The last dish we had was baked plaice with courgette, endive and new potatoes. Good service with beautiful bright fittings that made you feel like sitting in a hot house with glass roof. Great for a novelty value and reasonable price for trendy Northern European."
603497710,50,"August 6, 2018",AMAZING. MUST-DO!,"Truly gourmet vegetarian/pescatarian food. We went there for lunch, and the quality of the food and balance of flavors was extraordinary. The chefs are obviously extremely talented and knowledgeable. May very well be the best restaurant I’ve ever been to, and I have had my share of fine dining experiences. And this was only lunch! You have to go if you enjoy fine dining."
602940739,30,"August 5, 2018",Started off so well,We booked in for dinner at 8.30 on a Monday night for the six course tasting menu and accompanying wine flights. It started off so well with everything looking and tasting delicious. However as the restaurant emptied the service just completely lost its way. They forgot to serve one of our wines and the gaps between courses for longer and longer. We gave up after 2.5hrs and after spending an hour watching the kitchen get cleaned. We asked for the bill but no questions were asked about why we were doing this with a course still to go.So a good start but a terrible finish mainly let down by poor service.
602884226,50,"August 5, 2018",Unique and original restaurant concept,"Looking for a place for dinner in walking distance to where we stayed in Amsterdam, we walked to De Kas (""The greenhouse"") and got a table for two (just by chance - they told us they're fully booked weeks in advance). The ""garden to table"" concept was a very pleasant surprise - basically, they start from the products available at their vegetable gardens and prepare a 6 course meal. Naturally this emphasizes the vegetarian twist with small additions of fish or meat to harmonically complement the crops which are fresh and tasty. The way our menu was prepared leant towards the oriental side which gave the whole dining experience a somewhat exotic note. Sitting in the former greenhouse with a beautiful view of the surrounding park, the very friendly and attentive staff and the nice Dutch (!) wine made this a very pleasant evening. With such a unique experience behind you, one mustn't be surprised by the bill ;-)"
602879213,50,"August 5, 2018",Excellent Restaurant,Yesterday evening I celebrate the birthday of my wife. We had a wonderfull evening in this restaurant. Unique location and Great food served by friendly staff. Will come back for sure.
601907952,30,"August 1, 2018",Overpriced,Our travel friends were told that this restaurant was fantastic so they made reservations for the four of us. Located in a greenhouse that served a 3 or 4 course menu. We were told that it was a new menu.Basically we ate small portions of greens and herbs but well presented.The soup was about 3 spoonfuls and very salty.The main course had one slice of beef.The bread was very good and the wine was decent.At the end we all looked at each other and couldn’t believe that we had just spent 130 euros on what I would call an appetizer.
601726674,20,"August 1, 2018",Overrated would be an Understatement,"A friend recommended De Kas as the Dutch equivalent to the LOST KITCHEN in Freedom Maine (which sells out for the year in about 18 hours). With its farm to table concept, you were served what was in season or freshly killed.First the good stuff. The greenhouse where the restaurant is situated, is located in a park. The setting was nice as you felt like you were outdoors. Adjacent to the dining room is another greenhouse where they grow many of the veggies using the latest all natural (so I was told) horticultural techniques. The service was quite capable, efficient and friendly. The wine selection was nice although we didn't try the pairings.Now the bad stuff... The seats were very uncomfortable. They would be better suited on your patio and not in a restaurant. While the food was very tasty, the portions were extremely small. We all said each course was more like a tasting. The first three dishes to come out were all vegetarian and while they had some different ingredients, they tasted the same. Next came the soup which was delicious to be sure but two spoonfuls pretty much emptied the bowl. Next came the main course which was some kind of game. I had to look for the miserly slice of meat and found it hiding under a leaf. Finally dessert which was a half a cupcake with some sauce. I wish I could tell you exactly what was served but it was quite forgettable once you left. On the other hand, i can recite, course by course what we ate at the LOST KITCHEN 14 months ago.Some restaurants don't allow infants. We were subjected to a crying baby for some of the time. I assume De Kas doesn't have such a policy and therefore we had to listen to an infant acting out. ATTENTION young mothers and fathers... Your crying, squealing kid isn't cute! It's annoying to those around you. If you must bring Jr. and he starts crying, take him out. The others will appreciate it.You shouldn't spend 150 Euro and walk away hungry. At the end of the evening, the Peggy Lee classic, ""Is That all There is"", was rolling in my head. We went back to the hotel and had a sandwich. Needless to say, we will not return."
599742237,50,"July 25, 2018",A Unique Dining Experience,Set in a greenhouse the restaurant either grows their own food or uses local produce. There is one 3 or 4 course menu depending on what's fresh. The food is exquisitely prepared and artfully presented. An incredible mix of flavours and textures. We will be back.
599347984,40,"July 24, 2018",Arrogant and overpriced,"This place prides itself for being ahead of the wave: healthy and sustainably produced local food.Having been around longer than the competition, we found that they have become rather self satisfied. There is no fundamental desire to meet the customer’s demands; the opposite is true. The customer is supposed to sit back in awe for the great things provided for him.We were severely disappointed. Service was substandard, inadequate and frankly incompetent.We were given no choice of dishes: there is a daily menu with no alternatives on offer. Three vegetarian dishes before a little morsel of fish arrived.What an overpriced arrogance! I strongly advise against eatin here.We will definitely not come back!"
598329398,40,"July 21, 2018",Super high quality and healthy food,The restaurant is known for cultivating their own ingredients close by. The quality of the food is excellent and also the wine is very good. If you like to eat a big portion it is not the place to be. They are really focusing on high quality healthy food in a reasonable portion size. Certainly recommendable.
597003542,50,"July 17, 2018",Amazing flavors!,We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 course lunch at De Kas. It is very hard to get a table if not booked in advance but we took a gamble on a last minute Monday lunch booking and got in. The portions are not large however the flavors are so strikingly put together that we walked away perfectly satisfied. In addition to the prix fixe selections they served us two other amuse bouche that were delicious. The wine pairings were delightful as well.
596781058,50,"July 16, 2018",dinner in the park,Wonderful restaurant in a greenhouse in the middle of a park. Oysters and champagne on an outdoor patio overlooking the park. Inside to the greenhouse for a fix Prix meal of all natural local ingredients grown on the property or purchased from local suppliers. Nice leisurely pace and wonderful servers. Never felt rushed. Very spacious seating and noise level at a minimum.
596469860,50,"July 15, 2018",Perfect lunch,"We went for my fiancées birthday lunch on recommendations of a friend and it could not have been better. A lovely couple of hours spent on the terrace in the sunshine with some of the best food I have ever eaten. The price was ""reasonable"" for the experience, with it obviously a pricey place but you get what you pay for. I think the ideal for us was the lunch rather than a later dinner sitting but you do need to book well in advance."
596461593,50,"July 15, 2018",Beautiful Birthday Meal,Came here on a recommendation and we were not disappointed! We went for thr 3 course lunch menu with a cheese platter which id definitely recommend. Lunch was served on the patio with a stunning view of the gardens. Service was great and they even brought me out a card and some special honey when they heard it was my birthday. Would absolutely come back here next time we're in Amsterdam!
594733608,40,"July 9, 2018","Unique setting and fresh as advertised,,,,wish the food tasted better","De Kas is a wonderful dining experience with a marriage of a unique greenhouse dining area, open kitchen, fresh veggies grown onsite and a 6 course fixed menu. While De Kas' attentive staff attends to your beverage choices you are left to enjoy the ambiance of the open dining area while awaiting delivery of each course. As dishes arrive, they are described by the server and the taste adventure begins. Frankly I can not remember any specific dish other than they all tasted a bit off or strange and looked decorative on the plate. Granted my veggie palate is not fully developed but I did fully appreciate De Kas' complete dining experience."
594144314,30,"July 8, 2018",Falls short of its setting,"Beautiful location and a unique experience to eat in a working greenhouse, but the food and service fell short of the setting.Some of the individual dishes were very good to great, but the wait between courses was distractingly long. On average, there was a 22 minute break between the four non-dessert courses. I'm not sure if the kitchen was in a particular jam the night we were there or if it is normal, but it made us more critical of each dish, and ultimately the food couldn't overcome the service.For a better tasting menu experience in Amsterdam, look into Daalder."
594105780,50,"July 8, 2018","Fresh, local food- just great","This restaurant is in a large conservatory and kitchen garden and serves, as far as possible, only its own local and seasonal food. The explosion of contrasting, complementary and sometimes unexpected tastes was just wonderful. A small portion of fish complemented the otherwise vegetarian cuisine. Even as a non-vegetarian, i loved it."
593893172,40,"July 7, 2018",very good,"Great restaurant in a unique setting. Food was all great. Wine list was a bit lacking, however. A good option regardless for lunch or dinner."
593827939,50,"July 7, 2018",Amazing place - do not miss it!!,"Recommended this by someone who lives in Amsterdam - would never have found it otherwise and probably would not have got a table had we not booked ahead, but it was a highlight of our weekend.5 course tasting menu - we chose to have the wine with it.Incredible food - a lot was vegy and using local produce - loved the location in the greenhouse and service was similarly superb. One of the best places we have eaten."
593172311,50,"July 5, 2018",Perfect place to eat - highly recommended,"This place has both a fantastic atmosphere and offers great meals for resonable prices. Located out of the city centre, but with a tram stop near by, so very easy accessible. Staff was very friendly and service minded and we loved all the courses. Choose this restaurant if you want to try something authentic both Dutch/international food."
592076928,40,"July 1, 2018","Unique, great place for lunch","Being in a glasshouse with a menu of food sourced almost entirely from their own gardens, this was a lovely dining experience.The room itself was interesting including the climate control (glass panels opened and shut automatically depending on the temperature). Is was also lovely to be surrounded by gardens, only 10 minutes by taxi from the city centre. After our meal we had a wander into the glasshouse were some of the herbs and vegetables were grown - a really nice feature.The food was beautifully presented and provided some really surprising (in a good way) taste combinations. Very creative. The dessert was a highlight but we enjoyed every course of the set menu.I would highly recommend for a lovely change of pace, for the interesting location and menu and for the attention to detail."
591506462,50,"June 28, 2018",Wonderful Lunch in the Garden,"Seated on the patio of this lovely greenhouse garden restaurant, we enjoyed a five course lunch menu with a delicious white burgundy on a perfect sunny, yet cool, afternoon in Amsterdam. Made the reservation a month and a half ago, rolling calendar, this is not a walk in spot. Everything served is grown in their hothouse or farm in the nearby country, eggs from their chickens and on this day the sweetest tenderest lobster claw from Netherland raised lobsters. The herbal tinctures and greens were top notch, the flavor combos super flavorful and definitely reflective of the make up of current modern multi cultural Netherlands cuisine. Nice wine list, beer, teas, water and soft drinks available. menu can be adjusted to reflect food needs or preferences. Great staff, super friendly. Beautiful area on the tram line."
590393586,50,"June 24, 2018",So fresh and elegant,"Dinner is in a greenhouse. No choice for the menu, although they actually do have a choice( I think Chicken is always available)Herbs growing as you walk in, simple tables. Excellent service,and the knowledge that you are eating a very fresh, organic meal."
590351749,40,"June 24, 2018",Eat organic fresh food produced in a Glass House,"It certainly a great experience to eat in this glass framed resturant,the atmosphere was great with sunny day.The food was excellent compared to 4-5 star resturants.Just order 3 or 4 course lunch and enjoy the good food.It is worth visiting the production of vegetable produced in the glass house.Excelent of company events and receptions.Make sure you reserve since it is very busy.The tram from Central Staion will take you there."
589760618,50,"June 22, 2018",Fabulous experience!,"We loved this restaurant! We went on a Saturday and arrived (very easy to get to via trams) a bit early. We were seated outside and offered complementary appetizers as well as drinks. After appetizers we went inside the restored greenhouse to our table. We opted for the full wine pairing dinner (I think it was $129) and were not disappointed. Each and every dish from our appetizers to our desserts was thought out well, absolutely delicious, and amazingly presented. Some restaurants do interesting but they lack a comprehensive flavor but not De Kas. Each and every morsel was savored. Each bite was an explosion of flavor. Just look at our pictures.Our daughter is going to Amsterdam in a month and we told her this restaurant is a must. Make reservations as they can get busy."
589017087,10,"June 19, 2018",Disappointing Dinner,We were excited to get a reservation at De Kas for dinner but really shocked at the stingy servings of food in a fixed price 5 course menu The wine was pushed hard while the meals took 2 hours to serve and we left hungry and not happyDon’t go to De Kas if you are hungry and want eat good food It’s a restaurant for the chef not the patrons
588489326,50,"June 18, 2018",Not to be missed greenhouse restaurant,"When you eat at De Kas, which is located in a stunning glass greenhouse in the center of a park you feel like you are no longer in Amsterdam but in the open countryside. The food was excellent made using fresh ingredients from their greenhouse (which you can walk through) and their farm. The wine list was complex and interesting and the service was very good."
586983316,50,"June 12, 2018",Fabulous food and atmosphere,This was our third time here the food is delicious very flavoursome some of which is grown in the greenhouse and gardens. This really is a special place for couples or friends.
585553181,50,"June 6, 2018",Interesting and entertaining,"I spent a lunch here with my girlfriend. I have to say the menu was scaring me at first, because of its eccentricity. As Italian, I am all about a huge dish of pasta al ragù and abundant portions. However, the quality of the food and the innovation with which they were presented left me surprised and happy. The food was actually good, and the experience outstanding. The location is a big plus, perfect for business lunches and romantic dinners. Strongly recommended!"
584680280,50,"June 2, 2018",Incredibal,We had been looking forward to our return visit after having a spectacular lunch at de Kas 18 months ago. Our dinner experience last night exceeded our high expectations. The set degustation menu was a perfect balance of seafood and spring vegetables entwined in a beautifully balanced five course combination which could only be described as incredible. The young waitstaff were all enthusiastic and delightful. Their exuberance and service ethos was refreshing and engaging. There’s no doubt that any return trip to Amsterdam will include a meal at de Kas.
584012116,50,"May 30, 2018",Farm to Table - No Joke - Best Meal Ever,"If you don't already know what De Kas is all about, you just hit the lottery for random restaurant searches! The concept is fantastic. You probably know that. (If not, do a bit more research and you'll be back.) You come here to find out if they execute what they promise... yes?Damned right they do.They could be Michelin starred. They want to remain grounded (pun), instead, and not have to worry about expectations of having/maintaining such. Just the same, we enjoyed every interaction with the kind and welcoming staff, the atmosphere is lovely, and the food was unbelievably good.Of course, what is growing is what is being served. There are no alternate selections, so if you're a picky eater who doesn't eat vegetables, maybe go elsewhere. Let them know if you have allergies... but otherwise check your potential dislikes/challenges at the door and open your mind to the symphony of flavor, color, texture, and finesse that comes out of the kitchen. The meal is primarily plant-based (duh - concept) and our meal lasted three hours over six courses with bread and amuse-bouche.Seasonal, beautiful, local (the fish comes from 60km away in the sea). The techniques are a blend of classic and molecular gastronomic cooking. The atmosphere is upscale casual. My description fails to convey it; see photos for more.We spent about €100 each including wine and cocktails which is quite an affordable high-end dining experience, particularly when you consider that the price for a meal of this caliber is usually two to three times that without the drinks.This was one of the great meals of my life. Certainly in the top five of the greatest meals I've ever had. Both persons who went with me feel the same. Although we live quite far away, we will return here every time we can even fit Amsterdam into a long layover. Book it!"
582483259,50,"May 24, 2018",Loved it,"Meal, experience, ambiance, service was all top-notch. Enjoyed it very much. The menu was full of fantasy and taste. And the building is special. Loved the motives on the champagne glass, you see the trees, the greenhouse even the storks on it! :)"

580757520,50,"May 16, 2018",Loved!,"So I'm not the biggest fan of set menu restaurants but De Kas was great. A bit of a drive from the main city center but the ambiance was so nice it was definitely worth. It's basically a restaurant in a green house with the open ceiling, which for me was unique and great considering the sun sets after 8:30 in May. Besides the great setting the food was fantastic as well as the service. Given it was a bit far from the main center I was concerned about finding a taxi so ordered an Uber but coming out several taxis were waiting so I wouldn't be concerned about that. Highly recommend if visiting Amsterdam."
580187265,50,"May 14, 2018",A Culinary Experience,Our group really enjoyed this dinner. Each course was beautifully prepared and tasted delicious. They grow most of their ingredients. It is very pricey but the atmosphere is quite casual in a restored greenhouse.
579757352,50,"May 12, 2018",Delicious farm-to-table dining,"Oh my goodness, our meal here has to be one of the top 3 I've ever had. We opted for the 5 course dinner with wine pairings and left absolutely stuffed. As they grow all their produce on site or on their nearby farm everything was fresh and delicious. Their menu is planned around what's in season, and all dishes are thoughtfully prepared. They happily accommodated my vegetarian diet and seem to accommodate a variety of dietary restrictions if you let them know beforehand. The waitstaff were pleasant and knowledgable, and selected some great wines to accompany the dishes. While it's an expensive restaurant the ambiance is somewhat casual. They offer aperitifs in their outdoor space and have a full bar indoors, and you can take a stroll through the greenhouse. It was fun to get a peek into the kitchen which is kind of connected to the dining area. My husband and I couldn't rave more about this restaurant and are looking forward to our next visit. I highly recommend making a reservation at De Kas for a special occasion."
578750619,50,"May 8, 2018",Lovely experience,"This was our second visit to Amsterdam, and I can’t imagine visiting the city again without visiting De Kas. It is wonderful here. Food is so fresh and beautifully presented. Staff are friendly and helpful. It’s lovely to see the gardens being tended to and then being presented with freshly picked vegetables! Wine pairing is great and a good value option. We look forward to returning!"
578634692,30,"May 7, 2018",De Kas,"It’s a nice place. The dishes are beautifully prepared and very unusual! But, take a long time to spend there. They take a long time between courses. Our total time were 3 hours inside the restaurant, not polite for a expensive restaurant."
578603483,50,"May 7, 2018",Stunning food and view,It was a beautiful Monday with temperatures of 26'c.Had a reservation for 1.45pm.Did the 4 courses.Food absolutely stunning.The cold cod dish with beure blanc was stunning- one of the best cods ever.The langoustine in curry Creme was amazing.My only comment is that the cauliflower should cone before the langoustine.Rhubarb is very good.Wines- had both the Dutch sparking and the Dutch white both drinkable but not outstanding.Service was a bit slow. Long pauses between meals!
578438211,50,"May 6, 2018",fantastic ! worthwhile !,"wow ! what a beautiful place with an impressive setting in a greenhouse within a park !excellent service , the food is mouthwatering , all from the own gardens and seasonal, the menu (5 or 6 courses, fixed) changes every week.

578292235,50,"May 6, 2018",Best meal of my life!!!,"Wow, I literally cannot stop talking about De Kas. Everything about the experience was truly magnificent. We went our first night in Amsterdam and our standards were set very high for the rest of the trip.Every dish that came out was just amazing, from flavor to presentation. The actual chefs were the ones who brought it out to us they were so enthusiastic describing what they created, it was so endearing.We opted for the wine tasting which I also recommend. I also consider it to be an incredible value for what we received. It came to just $107pp for the 5 glass wine tasting and 6 course meal. The actual grounds for the restaurant are beautiful, service top notch, incredible meal and presentation. Book now!!!!"
578236755,50,"May 6, 2018",What a restaurant!,"What an experience we had at De Kas. First of all the park where the restaurant is in is just beautiful! We had an apero outside with oysters and champagne and the oysters were divine, so fresh and tasty! We then headed inside where we had delicious bread waiting on the table and then went for the 5 course menu. Everything was so good, there was not a single course that we (group of 8) were disappointed by!I hope I can return soon to this beautiful and so special place."
578109593,50,"May 5, 2018",Elegant and Different,"Excellent service. Well-conceived and excellent dishes aesthetically presented. We all love vegetables and thoroughly appreciated having them so carefully prepared while not dominating the dishes that included fish or meat, which shone as well. The setting is marvelous! We had lunch on a cloudy day in April. It was perfect- although I wonder if it might be a bit bright and hot on a fully sunny and warm day? I hear those happen occasionally in the Netherlands... I wish I had taken notes on specific dishes as our jet lag has erased most details, but we all would gladly return. Recommended wines paired well. Also note that our no dairy pescatarian guest was welcomed and treated beautifully."
577999240,50,"May 4, 2018",Fabulous Dinner,"What a unique dining experience! The setting is stunning, a large greenhouse with abundant light and an open kitchen. The menu is set each day, depending on what is fresh in the garden. Each course is plated beautifully, and the ingredients are unique. We had a beetroot gazpacho with burrata and blackberries, fried asparagus with chicory and potato, braised turnips with egg yolk, poached chicken with endive and mole, and lemon and sage sorbet with praline and rice pudding. Each dish had other vegetables, sauces and garnishes, and was unlike anything we have tasted before. Service was friendly and efficient, and the entire experience a delight."

574893964,40,"April 22, 2018",Awesome settings and flavors!,"We went to de Kas for lunch (they have a great terrace in the sun) on 19th of April witch was the first day of the new menu. The tasting menu is 4 or 5 dishes, aka with or without desert. Very nice settings, as the restaurant is located in an old greenhouse in a park, easily reached with bike/walk/tram. 80% of what they serve, they have grown themselves. The flavors can’t be described in words! Great value for money, and I could recommend de Kas to anyone visiting Amsterdam."
574609117,50,"April 20, 2018",Fabulous meal!,"The restaurant itself is beautiful. Only a short distance from the city center and worth the trip.We opted for 6 courses with wine pairings.

573828258,20,"April 16, 2018","Great food, terrible service and poor wine pairing","Was looking forward to De Kas for dinner with our group. Concept is current and they checked all the boxes. Food did not disappoint but everything else, service in particular really let it down. Now we were a group of 12 but they seemed content to ignore every basic dinning need. Maybe it was an off night, maybe you should avoid going on a Monday, i’m not sure but I do know I won’t be back nor will I recommend others to go. Disappointing."
573535896,50,"April 15, 2018",Amazing experience,"What a place and well worth venturing slightly out of the city, easy to find on the tram and a great concept. We don’t eat fish and we’re not really massive fans of vegetable based dishes but this place was exceptionalFirstly they switched all the fish dishes for us and we had a superb Lamb in Curry sauce fo Main. From the Amuse to the bread, the two vegetable starters and the local beer and wines it was all round classThe service and atmosphere were relaxed and perfect and looks like everything is grown insideDo it"

Most of the food is produced either in the greenhouse itself or locally.The menu is fixed and the dishes are well presented. Many interesting combinations with great tastes.The service is normal, and the price level is quite high.I would recommend this restaurant if you like to experience something different than most places."
572518928,50,"April 10, 2018",Fantastic.. great experience.,"We had eaten at a wonderful restaurant the evening before so considered cancelling our lunch here due to being another tasting menu... are we so very glad we didn’t.It’s in a fabulous position just outside the centre, we cycled from our hotel which took 20 mins and was pleasant experience. It’s in a beautiful setting in the most amazing greenhouse/glass building.The menu was impressive and I was so impressed by the freshness and unique way they presented vegetables. They accommodated for me being coeliac no problem. We did the wine pairing which I’d recommend. It was a fabulous lunch in a beautiful setting and made our weekend visit to Amsterdam even more special. Definitely not to be missed."
572422726,50,"April 10, 2018",One of my favorite meals ever!,"This place was suggested to us by friends and we weren't disappointed at all. First of all, it is located in an old greenhouse which has been retrofitted as a restaurant and the setting was amazing. I happened to be going for my girlfriend's birthday and let them know that, so they had a nice gift when we arrived with a personalized note. That was a nice touch. The meal itself was a tasting menu, based on the vegetables available from their organic farm. I'm not typically worried about organic foods, but it was an added benefit I suppose. We opted for the 6 course meal with wine pairing and it was amazing. There were many items on there I typically wouldn't order, but I loved them all and learned about some new foods that I'd consider in the future. My girlfriend also tried a few things that she normally wouldn't have considered and I think every course became her new favorite dish. The service was also amazing and very personalized with great detail surrounding each course and wine pairing. Putting everything together, the location, ambiance, service wine, and food made it one of the best meals and experiences I've ever had. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a special night out."

The meals were fresh, green, tasty, beautiful. The desert, a cucumber sorbet was worth 3 Michelin stars. Bravo!"
570780264,50,"April 3, 2018",Very special place that's worth the trip.,"I read about this restaurant in Time Out Amsterdam. So glad I decided to book it and persuade our friends to make the tram ride there. Its is in a site that used to be the Amsterdam Municipal Nursery, dating back to 1926. The restaurant is inside a set of incredibly chic greenhouses - the main restaurant in a huge greenhouse, very contemporary and a great place for any time of day and any time of year. Produce is grown on site and The menu is set and depending whats available. We had Langoustine tempura with butterhead lettuce, carrot puree and spelt flakes. Absolutely delicious, followed by fresh gnocchi then fish with final and bouillabaisse. The chocolate sorbet was shared! Very good service and a good view of the kitchen. Best meal of the trip. @32.50 for 3 courses. Wine pairing is an option."
570453616,50,"April 2, 2018",High end dining,"This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend of our son and we'd also seen it in a Sunday Travel Supplement. Took tram 9 out from the Rembrandtplein to Hogeweg and the restaurant in a converted and beautifully done out greenhouse is directly opposite the stop. We had time to spare before lunch so walked along the shopping street for a while - nice area with some interesting individual shops .Inside the restaurant was a different experience from most other restaurants we've eaten in over the years. Climate is well controlled with assurances it won't be uncomfortable in either hot or cold weather outside. Attentive service from the very pleasant staff, with each course explained when it was served. Should say now that the menu changes daily and there is no choice - but with food as good as we had, who needs choice? Delightfully light and full of natural flavours there was nothing we didn't like. Tried to book for he following evening but had to go on a wait list so that tells you how good it is. We didn't expect to hear anything from them so had booked somewhere else but full marks to the office staff for contacting us when they had a late cancellation. Shows the quality of service you get here."
569807450,50,"March 30, 2018",Delicious fresh food and friendly service in great setting,Incredible flavours drawn from the freshest produce grown on site. Had the wine pairing too which complemented nicely. Light and fresh setting in the greenhouse. Super friendly and helpful waitress. Highly recommended.
569424992,50,"March 29, 2018",Surprising vegetables,"Although De Kas is not a vegetarian restaurant per se, they are very creative with vegetables. Expect small dishes with surprising combinations of tastes. The restaurant uses vegetables out of its own greenhouse (“De Kas”). Hence, the menu depends on the vegetables that happen to be available. There is a set menu with 5 or 6 courses.Airconditioning in a greenhouse turns out to be a challenge. We were in a corner with a quite cold draft. The staff was helpful and willing, but unable to really solve the problem."
569414838,50,"March 28, 2018",Amazing food grown primarily on site - fabulous,What an experience this was. The food which is all grown on site or nearby is turned into exquisite courses in a degustation type meal. I loved them all and would highly recommend this restaurant. Service was also great and the atmosphere is very inviting.

This restaurant is not for those on a tight budget. We took the number 9 tram, fare now E3 and no cash taken after 31 March 2018, use contactless. Each tram has screens showing the next stop so easy to use. We had a tablecloth but I noticed some tables didn't, as I don't often get to restaurants such as this I would have been disappointed with a bare table."
568494738,30,"March 24, 2018","Great food, indifferent wine by the glass, check your bill","A lovely setting in a greenhouse in a park, where fresh vegetables are the stars of the day. Table cloths on only a few tables and rather uncomfortable basket chairs. Delicious and copious food for the set lunch including 2 substantial vegetable amuses-bouche, and 4 fine courses including cod as a main. Accompanying wines invariably came from long-opened bottles including a flat fizz from Limburg (which was replaced with a fresh bottle but poured into the already flat original). Many, many such unfinished bottles in the wine storage. Better to order the excellent food and a bottle of wine from a good and eclectic list, especially as extra glasses of wine may find their way onto the bill."

For those who don't know you eat insied a huge greenhouse. they have gardens here where they grow most of their vegetables and herbs.On our last visit we chose the 5 course menu for 52.50 euros (I usually have the 6 course menu for 60 euros...) and it was simply delicious. The freshness, presentation, taste and overall experience is just superb. The service is equally excellent. They cater for dietary restrictions without a blink and deliver the result in a subtle whoosh.All in all a great meal experience in a great and original location.De Kas, see you next time I'm in Amsterdam!"

562252273,50,"February 23, 2018",Adventure in Eating,"In January my friends and I were visiting the Amsterdam area for a conference. We were looking for an adventure, not just a meal. And de Kas did not disappoint. It was a very cold windy day so we were glad when they gave us the big table next to the fire place. We ordered the wine flight along with each course. I loved the single menu. So often I'm given too many choices and I order things I know rather than branch out and try new things.Zander and his team did a great job of presenting each new course and wine. They laughed with us and seemed to enjoy our enthusiasm for the food. The next time I'm in Amsterdam I will make a point to return."

Only but is the wine cellar, because there are not many options, but is a minor issue because the ones they have are really good.I hope to be back again soon."
558380939,50,"February 4, 2018",Wow! Farm to Table in the middle of Amsterdam!,We arrived to Amsterdam late and went straight to De Kas for what ended up being a very memorable meal...this is the old City Greenhouse that has been restored and provides a Farm-to-Table experience in the middle of Amsterdam. The six-course meal was reasonable in price and mostly vegetarian although you don't even notice....the last course was duck...the entire meal was beautiful...it was our waitress' very first day and you couldn't tell because she had so well trained. The entire staff was terrifiic and we started with a tour of the greenhouse before sitting down...friends in Amsterdam were amazed we knew of De Kas...this was memorable and worth going to Amsterdam for.

Wonderful and beautiful.Oh the dessert was a chai infused salted caramel extravaganza that was absolutely delicious..."
555202564,50,"January 21, 2018",Delightful and surprising,"De Kas serves surprisingly good food at very reasonable prices. They don't offer offer an à la carte menu but instead have a 5 or 6 course taster menu.The courses are varied and provided amazing flavours using local produce (many of the vegetables are grown locally in the greenhouse). Portions aren't huge but even after the 5 course menu you are comfortably full - and there is always an option of the cheese course.6 courses were (in Jan 18) €60 which given the quality of the food is exceptionally good value.The location of the restaurant is quirky (its in a park), its a little out of town but its well worth a trip...Truly exceptional food."

549648643,50,"December 27, 2017",A new experience,"This was more about the whole experience rather than being just about the food. I've never been to anywhere like this before. I have food intolerances which I had emailed about the week before.When we arrived, our coats were taken to the classroom and we were shown to our table,A waiter then came over to explain the format of the dinner, and this continued throughout the evening, with each course described beautifully. The waiters knowledge of the food and wine was brilliant.The food was amazing throughout the whole evening, portions were small as I had expected but there was a different taste with each course and everything tasted so fresh and wonderful.If I went again, I would probably choose a bottle of wine to share rather than opting for the paired wines for each food course, although it was nice to try different wines with each course.It's a set tasting style menu and I quite enjoyed being told what I was going to eat instead of having to choose from a menu. I wasn't sure I would like it but I did, a totally new experience."

First of all we had a glass of Riesling sprakling wine coming from the Netherlands. Great experience, I never knew that the Dutch are making wines... after this we had a menue with around 6 courses, mainly consisting on regionally grown as well as self-grown (!) vegetables, seasoned with herbs, which mostly also were self-grown. Really excellent. I would honestly suggest to make a reservation."

Set tasting menu with a choice of 5 or 6 courses combined with a wine pairing menu of class. The food is tremendous with excellent attention to detail and real farm freshness in evidence.

We were a group of 14 friends, and the staff (which is truly kind and professional) easily found us a table for lunch. The location is stunning and the menu (even if is standard, 3 or four dishes plus the possibility to order a cheese plate and oysters); there is a vegetable garden just between the entrance and the kitchen, from where the chief takes the vegetables to cook some superlative plates. Also the wine list is very good.The price is quite high, but it's also absolutely adequate to the entire experience.If you are in Amsterdam, you definitely should have a lunch or dinner here!"

It is light, you aren’t sleepy, tasting is easier, and you can combine it with business; how nice life can be.This time I met for a bite and a talk in restaurant De Kas. It is situated in the centre of Amsterdam in their former City greenery. It is a lovely place with enough parking space in the neighbourhood. A bridge brings you into the park. In the greenhouse they grow a part of the vegetables and herbs they use in the dishes. So, it is certainly fresh. They have only one lunch menu, but ask if you have certain dislikes or allergies. In their menu is a lot of vegetables and fruit although it is not a vegetarian restaurant. We made a reservation but there were enough free tables. A decent lunch is still not trending The Netherlands.We took the oyster they offered and started with a grilled pear, with radicchio and beetroot. It had a nice taste and great design. The sweet pear matched perfect with the bitter of the red leaves. The leek soup had the right textures and got some surprising herbs and some nuts. We ended with the fish baked on sourdough bread and skipped the desert. They have a nice selection of wine by the glass and the pricing is ok."
546334104,50,"December 9, 2017",Upgrade!,"Flew out on Saturday morning, fly back Sunday evening, so we chose to eat at De Kas as it’s our “go to” restaurant in Amsterdam.De Kas has changed slightly, in a good way! Our waiter mentioned that new chefs have joined the team and it really shows. The food has always super fresh and vibrant and it’s now been taken to a new level. The aroma of the food is equal to the look and taste. We have always loved the fresh seasonal foods and everything now feels more modern and experiential. We had a fantastic evening, thank you."

We asked to be moved due to very annoying guests, and the staff was very accommodating to do so. The presentation was fabulous, only to be outdone by the flavors. It was a set tasting menu that allowed us to experience a myriad of flavors during the evening.The setting, in the greenhouse, was spot on!"

Once the hostess found us, we were warmly greeted, our coats taken to be hung up in the cloak room, and we were shown to our table. The staff were perfect, being there and making sure we were taken well care of, but in no way hovering. It is a set menu based on what looks good from the garden, as others have mentioned. Every dish was as close to perfection as one can imagine, each with a perfect combination of both textures and tastes. I feel so fortunate that this restaurant ended up on our agenda for our 3 day stay in Amsterdam."

543030945,40,"November 24, 2017",Charming and Delicious,"Not for the light of wallet, but excellent. Lovely space in a refurbished greenhouse in the midst of a park (very near a #9 tram stop) serving a menu based on what is available in their own gardens. Prix fixe menu with a choice of either 5 or 6 courses. Wine pairings are available. We were there for dinner in the winter, so we had oysters first thing. Each of the courses was a tiny dish of creative flavor explosion very precisely and lovingly prepared. The main course of veal cheek was meltingly soft. The least favorite food part was the dessert - a lemon sorbet (it was very cold outside) and seemed too airy and contrasting after the meat. The most favorite was either the pickled pumpkin with a coriander mayo, the veal, or the amose bouche with a wonderful celery, parsley ailoi and fried tapioca chips to dip. Service was so-so. We waited sometimes 20 or 30 minutes between courses and sometimes just sat there with no water or wine left on our table. Hard to get the waiter's attention. Many of the dishes are built in the same manner - a small amount of a base vegetables with a flavorful sauce and something crunchy along side. Wish they would mix that up a bit. All-in-all, we're glad we went. Expect to pay about 100 euro per person if with wine."

We ordered two set menus, with a accompanying wine selection. The food was excellent in every way: well presented, perfect quantity, very nice tastes and interesting textures. I was impressed how the vegetables were cooked and presented. In my view, this restaurant easily compares to Michelin star rated restaurants, with the added bonus that the restaurant is less formal.The service was impeccable. I also got excellent advise regarding the wine selection, and all the wines were of excellent quality. The restaurant was completely full, party with larger groups of people. From what I could judge, some people were there with friends or their significant other, others were there for work dinners. Very pleasant and relaxed atmosphere. The tables are not too close together so that one can talk privately. This is certainly a restaurant experience I will positively remember for years to come."

We had a choice of 3 or 4 courses - the only difference between the two being a dessert course for the 4 course option. The food, itself, was fresh and delicious but the meal was very veggie-heavy. While we wished there were more meat incorporated into the dishes, the beautiful scenery and attentive staff more than made up for the experience. Highly recommended!"

The setting in a former green house among a beautiful park is fantastic. We couldn't find more romantic fine dining place for the late summer night. The food was delicious and well prepared. The wine list was well thought and fair in price. I love the inventive modern Dutch cuisine with some Nordic touch (though combinations and experiments are not always successful). Our friends, just as us, are passionate gourmands and hobby cooks, so we actively discussed all the combinations, ingredients and wine matching with the waiters and they promised pass our ideas to the chefs.

Location is great, wonder around the parc before going into the restaurant. When we were there, there were storks in the area."
537693750,40,"November 1, 2017",Nice Setting,"We enjoyed a nice evening at De Kas. The setting was excellent in an old green house. One negative is that we ordered a bottle of wine. We quickely drank it and they open a second bottle with out asking us. Honestly, we probably would have ordered a second bottely of wine. It would be another wine since the first was not our favorite. Remember, wine edicate is only to return wine if it has spoiled. Food was well prepared and interesting. The bread was the best."

537248277,50,"October 30, 2017",Greenhouse dinner,"The restaurant is located in a former greenhouse in the middle of Frankendael park. The restaurant grows it's vegetables, menu changes daily. The dishes are creative and the ambience is good. Can get a bit loud when the house is full.Reserve in advance, gets pretty booked out.The service is attentive and friendly. One time I arrived there to find out they had lost my reservation. Although the place was full, they found a way to get us a table after a glass of wine in the bar."

536479003,50,"October 27, 2017",My favorite restaurant,"This is my favorite restaurant in Amsterdam. All products used are typical dutch, grown in their own greenhouse or farms around Amsterdam. The menu always depends on what they have available from the greenhouse and farmers so everything is in season. You just tell the waiter what you don’t eat and the menu can be adjusted to you. The rest is a surprise and always a pleasant one! It’s chique but still unpretentious. On a busy night it can be a bit loud as the room is big but nevertheless the staff is very friendly and the food every time incredible."
536022233,40,"October 25, 2017",Unique and good,"While the food here is good and very unique, it is a multi course meal with tiny portions and takes some time to get through. Also while some meat such as veal, the courses are predominantly vegetarian. But the unique flavor combos keep it interesting. The ambiance is open and interesting, and they can accommodate large parties. They do not serve liquor, only wine and beer. And the wine selection is limited and just ok."

535196563,50,"October 22, 2017",ONE OF THE BEST MEALS OF MY LIFE!,"I am so enthusiastic to write my review of De Kas. It was truly such an incredible menu. Prior to arriving in Amsterdam, I did some initial research on where we should dine on our vacation. De Kas kept coming up, but I did not make a reservation. Through my research, I figure out that it is not super easy to get a reservation at De Kas. I decided to try my luck and call and see if I could get in for lunch. My request was granted! My group and I were pretty excited. The greenhouse setting in the park is absolutely magical and sets the stage for an incredible, vegetable focused meal. I am not the biggest veggie fan in the world, but De Kas opened up my eyes! I have so much respect for their vision of veggies first, protein on the side. The prix fixe menu was full of exciting flavor profiles that I have never experienced before. The food is fun and innovative. The wait staff was absolutely divine. Service was kind and prompt despite other guests that were trying to make their jobs EXTREMELY difficult. Think three toddlers one of which vomiting on the table. I cannot say enough positive about De Kas and would highly recommend it to foodies traveling in Amsterdam. A final comment, I found this restaurant to represent extremely high value for the price."
534904545,50,"October 21, 2017",Divin,"Even if I usually am not a big fan of vegetables, I was completely conquered. The place, the service, and the mood were fantastic, but the food was the peak of this evening. We will certainly come back to discover another delightful menu."
533253783,50,"October 15, 2017",Exceptional and memorable,"We came for lunch (easier to get a reservation) and were incredibly satisfied. The restaurant and greenhouse are beautiful in terms of ambience and setting. The food was fresh, creative, and delicious and they were able able to accommodate and change one dish of the fixed menu for me (I don't eat seafood). Service was impeccable. Highly recommend and I would certainly return if ever in Amsterdam again."
533228349,40,"October 15, 2017",Genuinely interesting culinary experience,"Location in the greenhouse is really nice, and unusual. Well worth the effort to find. Food is inventive. In the tasting menu we had, a couple of dishes we had were stunning. A couple of others much less so, but that's purely down to taste and available ingredients. Preparation of everything was very clever and because the menu is so seasonal, can imagine menu would be very different at different times of the year which is to be commended and adds to the experience."
532224304,50,"October 11, 2017",Simply Fantastic,"De Kas is a green house in a park East of the Amstel river. The ambience is simple and functional, the noise level is low. One can actually have a conversation without having to scream.Our fixed menu consisted of a series of small, very well prepared dishes that came at 5-minute intervals and that were explained by the waiter. Everything tasted intense, unusual, and just great. De Kas is not heap, but for a once in a lifetime experience, well worth the money."
532047721,50,"October 11, 2017",One of the best in town,We waited a long time to get a table because the restaurant is always full. the food was very good. The service was superb. the ambiance is very nice. Highly recommended.
529600294,50,"October 3, 2017",beautiful place and good food,be sure to book a table cause it can be hard to get one. It's a bit more expensive and outside of the centre but it's a beautiful place. The glass house adapted for a restaurant. Very nice atmosphere. Dinner has 5 dishes and all of them are amazing. Good place for a big groups as well
529186944,50,"October 2, 2017",Great tasting menu,We heard about de Kas on a travel video and read reviews in Lonely Planet and it was definitely worth making a reservation and taking a short taxi ride from central Amsterdam. The restaurant is in a park and has a green house and garden attached where they grow their own vegetables and herbs. The fixed price tasting menu is a good deal and you get to try unique dishes that highlight local Dutch ingredients.
528479669,40,"September 30, 2017",Very good tasting menu. Nice atmosphere.,"We had a nicely paced 5-course tasting menu. All of the dishes were good. The atmosphere nice. The wait staff rather good (not perfect). The wine pairings were good at an affordable price with generous pours.The tables are amply sized and generously spaced. The seats comfortable. The #9 tram (starts at A'dam Centraal) takes you to within 200' of the restaurant for easy access.The only criticisms I have is that the service felt ""preachy"" about the mission of the restaurant (""trying"" to use locally sourced produce, whatever that means, either you do or you don't always) and the wine descriptions. Some wait staff dressed more casually than befits such a setting. The attractive lights which are reminiscent of glass umbrellas catch the dead insects and should be cleaned. The greenhouse area with veggies was more for show and didn't produce enough veggies for the restaurant. That could be better and a fun diversion. The park adjacent to the restaurant seemed like a hangout."
528023869,50,"September 28, 2017",Amazing,We ordered a six dish menu! Lovely food! Each dish was a surprise of taste! I loved! Lot of vegetables. My husband liked mas did not love. His is a protein lover!
526866809,50,"September 23, 2017",Best Meal of the Entire Trip!!,"I'm really not exaggerating when I say this was the best meal I had on a 12-day trip of three different countries. This restaurant came highly recommended (its focus is on locally-sourced ingredients and the meals put the vegetables in the spotlight) and after dining here, I can see why.A friend and I booked a late dinner here on a Thursday night in September. We were staying near Vondelpark, so it was a bit of a trek out to De Kas. But the long tram ride was worth it. You enter through a park where you walk over a little bridge and there you see the old greenhouse ahead. Upon checking in, you're invited to see the garden before you're seated, which is a good way to introduce the fact that much of the dinner is grown locally.Dinner started with table snacks that were utterly delicious—fresh tomatoes tossed with caper leaves, green beans and a cracker with an incredible celery dip. I could've just had the bread and that celery dip and I would've been happy. But I'm glad I didn't! The first course was an incredibly fresh mackerel ceviche and then a roasted radicchio dish with roasted beets that was almost transformative. My favorite dish of the evening was a roasted veal dish that was cooked perfectly. Dessert was a poached plum, but by that point, we were a bit too full to really enjoy.The menu (€52.50 per person) is set and there's an option for a wine pairing (€22.50 for three) that works nicely with the courses. The service was excellent and the meal was perfectly paced—never rushed and you were able to really savor the unique flavors and textures.Ok, enough of my rhapsodizing. Just go. You won't regret it."
526575697,50,"September 22, 2017",A different kind of Diamond in Amsterdam,"So glad I had this restaurant recommended to me. It was really fantastic! Other reviewers echo my thoughts. The setting in an old greenhouse is different and interesting. The freshness of the produce really shone through in the quality of the food; I think the beetroot might also have been my favourite but it was a close call since all five dishes were fantastic. They were ""mostly vegetarian"" since that is what they grow ""in house"" but with some meat or fish in a couple of the dishes. Although I am not a vegetarian I could be seriously tempted if all vegetarian food was this good. The service was superb with waiting staff paying particular attention to provide alternative courses for people with particular religious, dietary or lifestyle requirements. Also agree with another reviewer that the choice of wine could be more expansive but we found a nice one to compliment the meal and that's all you need! Highly recommend this restaurant!"
524258013,50,"September 13, 2017",Beautiful food,We had a lovely evening period. The food combinations were delicate and creative. My favourite course was the beetroots with a beurre Blanc sauce. The setting is lovely and the spacing of the table allows for intimate dining. I think the cost is very reasonable for the quality of the food.
519873556,40,"August 31, 2017",Impressive concept!,The all-glass building is quite impressive. The food was prepared and the service close to impeccable. The history of the venue is interesting and the idea of re-purposing and creating a farm-to-table restaurant very inspiring.
519284658,50,"August 30, 2017","Stunning location, excellent food and great staff","Visited De Kas for a business lunch.Amsterdam is not yet a center for modern gastronomy, but De Kas is a step in that direction.Following the Scandinavian trend the kitchen is based on locally produced vegetables with only the necessary treatment. Beautiful servings without unnecessary garnish.Located in an old greenhouse the distance from production to the table is minimal. Fortunately it is also a beautiful space, so everything kind of adds up beautifully.Only negative point would be a rather small wine list, but that is only a minor issue.Pricing is reasonable giving the high standards."
518871360,50,"August 29, 2017",Among the Best,"We followed advice on several travel web sites and booked this place early. We asked for the chefs table and were waiting for it; got a phone call during our first day in Amsterdam that we were going to be seated there. After a small Uber adventure (new driver) we arrived. It is a magnificent setting, near a large park and with beautiful gardens surrounding. We sat outside for a glass of wine an a small appetizer and took in the gardens before being seated. The chefs table is unbelievable. A high top table in the kitchen with staff circulating around all evening. Everyone was wonderful - the sous chef was first out but by the end of the evening we had met everyone. All were great. The meal was stupendous. Truly a meal that could stand anywhere as a great example of local ingredients. The courses (9 - yea, 9) were very vegetable-forward and delightful. Meat was always a great accompaniment but never seemed to be the focus. It didn't feel like 9 courses. The wine pairings were absolutely on point. My favorite was a steak tartare with fennel crisps and a light herb salad paired with a spicy Furmint. Unreal. We got a tour of the kitchen and greenhouses as well. Here's my advice - when you're in Amsterdam make time to go to this place. Beg for the chefs table. You'll be rewarded with a meal that even us jaded foodies were left spellbound by. Thanks, folks."

You can have a perfectly good meal at De Kas; however, at least for me, it wasn't memorable. Not even memorable for the 5 minutes after I ate it. I have been to too many tasting menus where edible flowers are the main event. Too many places where there is always a bit of food in the middle of a plate where the waiter finishes it with a sauce poured from a beaker. It' ok when the sauce is sublime, however, at De Kas it was just some sauce. I am happily on my way to an Auberge in Bordeaux where I know that I will eat much better food, that it will look better and be at a lower price. I understand that De Kas has changed chefs. Perhaps they need a further tune up."
514292577,50,"August 17, 2017",Worth the trip..,"This was a beautiful surprise venturing to De Kas as our first dinner in Amsterdam. We are vegetarian and called to make sure they can accommodate us for their fixed dinner. You enter the park and go to the Conservatory greenhouse. Walk through the greenhouse to get a sense of their amazing vegetables and herbs. Each dish was an artistic creation of presentation and tastes. Service was fantastic you don't have just one waiter you have the staff attending to your needs. Water, cocktails, dinner. Everyone is there to give you a wonderful dinner experience."
513057595,50,"August 15, 2017",Great restaurant in beautiful setting!!!,Amazing place for romantic dinner with great food and outstanding service. The only tip I can give to the management is to extend a bit the wine list.
512821025,20,"August 14, 2017",Overrated,"De Kas still has a reputation, though it became more or less a tourist trap. The dishes are still pretentious, but they are not good enough to legitimate this. Only the desert with cherries was realky worth the trip. The rest was okay, but quite expensive. So was the wine. The location still is incredible and the staff know what they are doing. However, I cannot get rid of the felling that this place is overrated."
512103054,50,"August 13, 2017",Outstanding,"I shall start by awarding De Kas the Michelin Star it is worthy of. The aesthetic and function of the room is near perfect. As much thought has gone into the guests comfort as the menu itself. The night we dined, the menu was limited to a 5 coarse tasting menu which was outstanding. The greens were garden fresh and the chef was careful not to over complicate the dishes and let the food speak for itself. With most everything being locally sourced, even the recommendation of a Dutch sparkling wine over a French Champagne was well received and appreciated. Daniel provided service that was professional and personable, and took the time to give me and my daughter a tour of the greenhouse following our dinner. A very memorable evening for certain, and very possibly one of my most favourite dinner ever. Thank you De Kas for a very memorable evening."
511176435,40,"August 10, 2017",Healthy food!,"De kas serves healthy food in a large greenhouse-style restaurant with a glass roof which gives a nice impression in the evening. The food is home grown by the restaurant, expect low focus on meat."

Everything is so fresh and they change the menu daily depending on the fresh food that is harvested. Very clean place and the food is amazingly fresh and everything tasted so good. And the price is not bad at all.

The greenhouse is located in a nice park. The food is all very fresh and tasty. We really enjoyed all the flavors in the 5 course. De Kas is a ""must try"" restaurant when in Amsterdam."
508662111,30,"August 4, 2017",Not Our Cup of Tea,"Beware that the meal is primarily veggies. It's great for vegetarians but for us carnivores it was a disappointment.It's a lovely setting and the food is beautifully prepared and presented but if you are a protein fan you will not be happy. Note to De Kas - Why not post some sample menus on your site so that anyone coming can get an idea of a typical meal?The portions are really tiny and I'm not a big eater. The amuse bouche was one small piece of cauliflower with sauce and poppyseed crumbles. This was followed by beets topped with some burrata. Second course was braised chicory in curry sauce with some sort of grain topping. Then a dish with two 1.5"" pieces of zucchini topped with three mussels. The main was two very small pieces (1"" cube) of chicken breast with a few tiny pieces of pasta and sauce. The dessert was actually pretty good. One small scoop of ice cream with some poached plums.Leaving hungry we actually considered stopping for another bite.The service, although pleasant, was lacking. We were in the middle of our amuse when the server brought out our first course. We had only been there 15 minutes. We had to flag down another waiter for more wine. I had to ask for silverware when the second course arrived because the server never replaced it and didn't notice that I had none. For a fine restaurant these lapses are totally inexcusable.To the chefs at De Kas - perhaps you are taking yourselves too seriously. How bout an ala carte menu?"

So much food these days is so visually focused that they forget it needs to be delicious -- more important to be Instagrammable. Not the case here -- beautiful but bursting with flavor and freshness. The setting is so lovely and relaxing you'd never know you were in a city. Don't forget to check out the greenhouse and the gardens. A really good value. Wine pairings great too.

Restaurant De Kas was one of these recommendations and it was SPECTACULAR!The restaurant grows its own produce and gets its meat from local suppliers. It serves everything from a fixed menu which is dictated to a degree by what the farm has available and therefore brand new 6 days a week. It's as close to farm to table as you're going to get but don't let that lead you to believe you'll get anything short of an in incredible meal.Each course (there are 5) is a delicious combination of culinary creativity and beautiful plating all served and bussed by a stellar staff. The Dick breast serves this evening was absolutely flawless.I can't recommend this restaurant any higher but if Trip Advisor gave more than 5 stars, I'd give the max to De Kas!

They used various vegetables - roots, leaves, fruits, flowers - very creatively along with meats, fish, chicken. The presentation of every plate was very beautiful - full of colors, textures, solids, liquids, and it all tested very, very good.Portions were just the right size, and the servers' timing was perfect.

Also service is relaxed, friendly and competent. Also a nice choice of wines. A really winning concept offering to the lovers of vegetables an outstanding price/quality ratio. I will consider it also for business dinners."
495646512,40,"June 24, 2017",Creative use of ingredients from their own greenhouse,"In an extremely nice setting, you can taste creative dishes prepared with ingredients from their own green house. They know how to use herbs in a nice way. Cuisine is light, vegetables dominates over meat and fish. Menu changes often due to daily / seasonal availability of vegetables. Menu is fixed, they suggest matching wines for each dish.Food was very nice, while I did not like so much wines (Greco di Tufo was from a minor winery and was average).Not cheap (€87 each, including bottle of champagne and 2 different wines), but absolutely recommended for a dinner with friends."
495527463,50,"June 23, 2017",Simply fabulous,"Local seasonal food in superb surroundings. Set menu, 5 courses without wines 53 euro. Money well spent! Food was innovative, delicious and like mentioned earlier, seasonal and local. They have an attached green house, visit and experience what You are going to enjoy in your plate later! :) Staff was having good time and they enjoyed their work and it related into customer service. Friendly and professional, always smiling! 10 points!"
495157696,50,"June 22, 2017",Perfect Amsterdam ending!,"We were excited to try this place out as our last dinner on our 5 night trip to Amsterdam! This was the perfect combination of a lovely setting in a park, a bit away from the center, fresh farm to table food, a beautiful modern greenhouse setting and absolutely delicious, fresh food! They create a new set menu every week. It's 5 courses with lots of fresh vegetables which I love! The portions are very ample but since the food is on the healthier side, it's a pleasure to eat. Great wine pairings. Overall I thought it was reasonably priced for the quality, presentation and amount of food given to us. The server was excellent: very friendly, explained everything to us, showed us the greenhouse after dinner where they grow some of the food, and took our pics. It was an excellent ending to our first trip visiting Amsterdam!"
495129032,50,"June 22, 2017",An excellent dining experience in Amsterdam,"Hard to fine but don't miss this special dining experience in Amsterdam, Located in a park you have to walk from the street across a bridge to get to this restaurant. Our uber driver and his GPS got us close but the house next door wasn't amused when I knocked on the door to ask how to get to it. Once there experienced a great 7 course meal with most of the incredients coming from the garden in this greenhouse. Still reasonable for a 7 course meal too."
494159267,40,"June 19, 2017",Unusual meal,"We enjoyed the experience of this restaurent.we had a set meal of five courses freshly prepared in view of the restaurant. The food was slightly unusual from the average restaurent,a lot of the produce served was grown in their own greenhouse and garden."
493442493,50,"June 16, 2017",Fresh and stylish,"This is a fine little gem in Amsterdam. The interior in stunning, it’s pretty much a greenhouse in its entirety, and eyes very spaciously indeed. They grow their own fruit and veg in their own greenhouse, and farm their own meat. The set menu is a delight, just let yourself be surprised by their amazing concoctions of fresh ingredients, from starters through to the delicious desserts!This place will not disappoint, and is a great venue for couples, friends or business meals alike!"
493082647,50,"June 14, 2017",Excellent sustainable restaurant with creative dishes,"I went to this restaurant for a business dinner and was initially impressed by the sustainable focus of the food (with on-site greenhouse) and open and comfortable atmosphere.However, these did not hold a candle to the very impressive food, which was not only sustainable, but also creative, both in appearance and taste.From the appetizer to dessert, this excellent sustainable restaurant with creative dishes is highly recommended!"
492766359,50,"June 13, 2017",Excellent summer choice for lunch,"Fantastic setting, very tasty farm to table food choice, attentive service. Well worth the travel time to this restaurant off the typical tourist scene in Amsterdam"
492517603,40,"June 12, 2017",Lovely evening,"Dinner at De Kas was for a special birthday and the food didn't disappoint. My only sadness was, that when asked to confirm my booking the night before, I did say that I was bringing someone for a special birthday - but sadly this wasn't taken note of.This said, I would still visit again as it's a very special spot."
491970082,50,"June 10, 2017",A visit I will not forget,I look back fondly on De Kas and can't wait for an opportunity to take me back. The fixed menu is exciting and delicious. Staff are incredibly knowledgeable and open to answer and question. As I have a allergy they were highly accommodating. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience from start to finish.
491951325,50,"June 10, 2017",Expensive but Unique,"Yes this meal was expensive, BUT you can't get a meal like this anywhere else. Food is grown fresh there and take foods you hate and turn them into something incredible. It's a must do.One thing: Service was okay, but I think it was normal by Holland standards- just not American"
491806441,50,"June 9, 2017",Amazing food in a Greenhouse in Amsterdam!,"It's hard to imagine a better meal than our dinner at the Restaurant de Kas in Amsterdam. Each part of the tasting menu, paired with the perfect wine, was just a delicious surprise. A beet salad, like no beet salad I've tasted, melded flavors in a lovely, delicate way. The gazpacho, again like no other, contained almost no soup but leaves and lovely combinations of flavors to create such tastes. The beef, cut in strips, was also delicious ...and the dessert of rhubarb, cherry sorbet, pastry, and some other good flavors, just blew me away. Go there if you can."
491598749,50,"June 8, 2017",Really different restaurant,"We visited the restaurant for my husband's birthday and although it's not cheap it's a really good experience and amazing and different food. The emphasis is mostly on vegetables although a couple of the courses included meat and fish too, but they did vegetarian and pescatarian versions for us. All the vegetables and fruits used are seasonal and mostly grown there in the greenhouse, which is really nice.I'm not sure why a few reviews said the portions were small, we had 5 courses instead of 6 and we were so full!!! With all different sorts of things like they do and having 5 or 6 course, you don't want each one to be huge!The greenhouse setting in the park is really pretty and especially at night when it's all lit up."
491303262,50,"June 7, 2017",Amazing,"One of my top dining experiences, ever. For 52.50 euro, you are treated to a five courses of amazingly fresh, beautifully presented, intricately flavored food. All this in a beautiful greenhouse surrounded by gardens in a quiet Amsterdam park. My husband and two twenty-year-old sons are still talking about this dinner.The staff is young, fun and very knowledgeable about the food and wine. Service is impeccable and served at a leisurely pace."
491226820,50,"June 7, 2017",A great venue with good food,"After several attempts to book at short notice I finally got my act together and booked in time to get a table.It was well worth the effort. The dinner menu is fixed with the option of 5 or 6 courses inside a greenhouse looking out on water and greenery.The menu is hard to fault..subtle flavours, beautifully presented and, although the menu is fixed, they ask about dietary requirements and foods you don't like right at the start.There is a wine tasting menu if you want a fresh glass with every course. We set a Pinot Noir (well known) against a Dutch Dornfelder (unknown). The Dornfelder was empty first - enough said. Give it a try.We also had a Dutch sparkling wine with the amuse bouche. It's dry with a light sparkle - another one worth trying.The service was excellent - the staff were charming and knowledgeable, especially the female Sommelier who's knowledge on all the selections we made and how they'd go with foods was impressive.The venue sits a little out of the centre..probably a cab tide for some. It is a few metres away from the street in its own manicured gardens, approached over a pedestrian bridge.At €52/head for the 5 courses it seems a little more expensive than some restaurants in Amsterdam. In terms of quality, value for money and good experience this is a stand-out choice."
491011514,40,"June 6, 2017",Fresh ! But expensive,"Beautiful setting, fresh farm ingredients grown right in front of you, greenhouse effect Resturant and delightful preparations! Food is great. Portion sizes small and pricing fine dining.Worth a try once."
490174382,50,"June 3, 2017",Impressed,"Wow. For the picturesque setting: the dining area evokes a green house from whence one can look out to the resplendent surrounding greenery. For the friendly and courteous service. For the delightful 3 courses, each dish thoughtfully prepared, with freshness you can see, smell and taste. For the inventive presentation. For the fantastic value: I would've happily paid 3 times what we were charged.I just wish it were easier to get a reservation. Heading back to Amsterdam for a visit and De Kas is booked on the day I'm there."
489164080,50,"May 30, 2017",One of the best meals ever,"The setting, the informality, the creativity of the menu, the pacing of the dinner - it doesn't get better than this. Fixed menu, changes weekly, everyone eats the same thing. Well worth the extra time to get here, and worth every last euro of the cost."
487411385,50,"May 24, 2017",Leisurely dinner,This greenhouse restaurant welcomes its guest with natural light and a soaring ceiling. Our group opted for the full 6 courses and wine pairing which was a delicious way to spend a few hours. This is an understandably popular spot. Plan ahead for a reservation.
485636347,50,"May 19, 2017",Just Sublime,"De Kas is a most wonderful experience. Setting most unusual right in the middle of a lovely park and produce growing in adjoining greenhouse and vegetable plots. Each course beautifully prepared, presented and quite a unique experience, Set in a lovely tranquil public park - the public allotment area is well worth a stroll - if only to work up an appetite (not essential - given to lovely food). Service was excellent and staff most friendly - I even got guidance on how to properly grow fennel in my own garden. Price too was reasonable given such an excellent experience. Just a short trip on a tram from Dam Square. Make sure you book tho'!"
485417506,50,"May 18, 2017",The best Farm to Table!,"A fantastic lunch experience more than good food.De Kas is an elegant restaurant inside a park! Quite a lot of ingredients are grown at the garden next to the kitchen.I could feel love, respect, service.能夠吃到這麼有愛心的餐廳感覺很幸福！"
483878328,50,"May 13, 2017",Flowerfood,De Kas is not a restaurant but an experience. A true journey inside the tastes and colors of biofood designed using flowers.You will eat in a techno greenhouse surrounded by the trees of a beautiful park.Ultimately one of the best restaurant in Amsterdam.
483450244,50,"May 11, 2017",Haven't posted a review in a while but....,"Hands down one of the best meals I've had. This tops Bondi Icebergs (my previous favourite). Went for lunch, 4 courses with matching wines. Outstanding food and service, if you are In or going to Amsterdam do not pass in this place. Quite a distance from the city centre but so worth it. Had gone to Guts & Glory the night before and that was delicious but this easily surpassed it. Couldn't recommend if highly enough."
482340117,50,"May 7, 2017",amazing farm to table meal,We were staying at a VRBO a few blocks away and the owner had recommended this restaurant for an evening meal. The meal is an event. We enjoyed awesome courses. (6 courses total). Everything was amazing. the use of fresh veggies from the attached greenhouse and farm fresh ingredients was very inventive. the presentation and service is top notch.
482046927,50,"May 6, 2017","Was good, now even better","We enjoyed a real good, and relaxed, dinner at de Kas. With the new kitchen crew the menu concept changed a little; from three courses to now six courses with wine pairing (but at same price as before). Dishes are made with seasonal and local ingredients. All dishes we're executed perfectly with great attention for detail; combinations of foods work very well. The ambience (and the surrounding park) is beautiful. Staff is friendly. Value for money in Amsterdam."
481420340,50,"May 3, 2017",Delicious creative menu,"I am usually not a huge fan of ""creative cuisine"" - I often prefer traditional dishes and familiar tastes. But I have to say De Kas was an amazing surprise. Went there with a large group of friends and everyone had a great time. The food was served timely, the service was good (better than your average service in Amsterdam, which is not great) and all 5 dishes truly tasty. It's a fixed menu so you can't choose what you eat, but you won't regret it. At one point they served a beetroot gazpacho..I hate beetroots with a passion and yet I enjoyed the dish as it was absolutely delicious!!The setting is also lovely. Definitely worth the price and the hype."
480709858,50,"May 1, 2017",Lovely location and wonderful dishes,"It's a bit away from the center of Amsterdam and in the lovely setting.Warm welcome upon arrival and the service was pleasant.They accommodated Pescatarian meals and other special diet needs. The dishes were flavorful with beautiful garnishment.One small disappointment was there was no one at the door for us to retrieve our coats. Other than that, we had a lovely evening."
480669407,50,"May 1, 2017",Great lunch in a Greenhouse,"Strongly recommend to go in day time. This greenhouse restaurant allows plenty of sunshine but yet comfy to dine in. Blue sky, greens surrounding and the garden-creature alike dish would surely impress you.Lunch is a 2 or 3 course set with optional wine pairing. There is no a-la-carte but I do believe all diners are in chefs' good hand. Be adventurous and finish everything on the plate - they might look bit fancy but surely edible!!!!The restaurant also offered organic apples as souvenirs when the staff walked you to the door."
480515727,30,"May 1, 2017","Cool setting, poor service - avoid the tasting menus","We bought the full six course Chef's menu with wine pairings and expected decent service. It is apparent they are putting their effort into the food, including fresh vegetables from their garden, but the staff lacked training, and there was no apparent supervision on the floor. The wine pairings were always served after we were already eating the course (once almost finished), the wine pour sizes were very inconsistent, our water and wine glasses were empty four different times during the meal, and at one point I was thirsty enough to get up and walk across to where they had our sparkling water to pour a round for our table myself. No one came to interrupt me from doing so, which told me they lack supervision. For us, this problem and a lot of waiting between courses took away from enjoying the food, although it was quite well prepared. They need to remove the five and six course tasting menus or refocus on their service. It wasn't expensive, but overall I have to give them an average score."
479710367,50,"April 28, 2017",Gourmet dishes with a nice look,"This is the second time I visit this top restaurant of Amsterdam. Last time (a year ago) I tried ""chef's table"" which is more interesting from a gastronomical perspective, but can be a bit lonely if your company is not too interesting. This time I tried the 6-course dinner including wine package. One can with no doubt say that the wines are not up to the standard of the food. Anyhow, me and my 4 guests liked to sit in the nice eating hall with all tables full of activity and people. I will come back some day!"
479635162,50,"April 27, 2017",An out of the way food adventure,We had dinner here on our last night and it was a great way to cap off a very memorable Amsterdam experience. The menus are prixe fixe and in the 50 euro range for four courses. It's farm to table and the food was excellent. Needless to say the restaurant was packed and we had made the reservations approx. 2 month's earlier. We went to a lot of great restaurants in Amsterdam and we felt this was the best. Dinner for 3 including a bottle of wine and tip was approx $210 euros.
479469279,50,"April 27, 2017","Interesting, unusual and excellent",The freshest food in this buzzing greenhouse restaurant is beautifully prepared and presented. Friendly staff cope well with the large number of diners.

478730221,50,"April 24, 2017","Fun setting, creative food","Dined here with friends, hard to get a reservation, great setting inside remodeled city greenhouses. Very friendly, attractive, helpful staff. The food is locally sourced, organic, very creative combinations which change each day.We had braised chard with small bites of rose tenderloin, baked endive with gremolata,slow cooked chicken with white adperagus & radish, a delicious dessert of Rhubarb compote, elderflower ice cream & almond crumble.Would return often if possible!"

477680992,50,"April 21, 2017",Excelent food and accomodation,I have been to ' de kas' now for two times and each time I love the food. The price/quality rate is perfect. Its not a cheap place to eat but the quality of the food is amazing. Additional the greenhouse itself is beautiful and its a great to go to with friends or for business purposes.The staff is great in their service and I would recommend the restaurant to everyone.
477195274,40,"April 19, 2017","Nice food experience, great location","I went to De Kas with my girlfriend for dinner and we had an interesting food experience. We had a 5 course meal, 2 meat, 2 vegetarian and one desert. Even i am a meat guy, i can say that all the dishes were good and the fact the De Kas grows it's own veggies gives a great taste to everything in your plate. It was one of the most interesting meals i had, and even if the dishes are quite small, at the end i felt full. For and different food experience, try De Kas, i am glad i did it."
477077488,50,"April 19, 2017","Pricey, but totally worth it!","My girlfriend and I planned a dinner at De Kas after hearing a recommendation from one of our friends. Although there is a high price tag, it is well worth it considering the caliber of food that you will be eating here. This is a great place to go to if you are looking to step outside of your comfort zone and have the chef surprise you. Also, we felt great after the meal even though we were full, mainly due to the high quality ingredients that go into this meal. Overall, a great and delicious meal!"
476950245,50,"April 18, 2017",Amazing greenhouse restaurant,This restaurant is like no other! Its housed in a 1920's greenhouse. It's absolutely beautiful and the food is delicious. Some of the produce is grown on site too. The smell of growing tomatoes when you walk into the restaurant is unforgettable .You cannot chose individual dishes to eat but you are served the menu of the day with their home baked bread . They will accommodate any dietary requirements . The staff are charming . There is a good wine selection . This is a perfect venue for an understated sophisticated celebration!
476894204,50,"April 18, 2017",Great food at a nice location,"The food was great, and we are glad we took all six dishes, even though we were very skeptical of the fresh cheese dish, it turned out to be the best one, and they were all good.Service was good. Attentive and friendly staff. Thank you Benjamin, and the rest of you, for making the visit enjoyable."
476888352,50,"April 18, 2017",Fabulous experience,"We had lunch here and enjoyed true experience immensely. There was a set menu, but everything on it was very good. I opted for the wine pairing and tried some very pleasant wines that matched the food very well. Every dish was well thought out, and prepared using vegetables from their own garden. Lovely atmosphere, and he dining room is much nicer in real life than I thought it would be from the photos. Will definitely go back when I visit the city again. Thank you!"
476004644,50,"April 16, 2017",This is a must try when in Amsterdam,Gourmet food and unique surroundings with friendly services.Fixed menues combined with respect for seasonal ingredients. Don´t miss this restaurant while in Amsterdam
475841942,50,"April 15, 2017",A must when you are in Amsterdam!!,We had a truly memorable and exceptional dinner at De Kas ... We are spoiled New Yorkers and De Kas ranks as one of the best restaurants we have ever eaten at!I am shocked to read another reviewer called it pretentious! The staff from start to finish could not have been more pleasant and delightful! The food was nothing short of superb! The setting was exciting!!This restaurant is not to be missed!!
475826076,50,"April 15, 2017",Perfect lunch spot,This beautiful greenhouse/restaurant in the middle of a park was a wonderful find. Delicious home-grown produce on the fixed menu was creatively prepared and presented. A little outside of the central Amsterdam area but well worth the trip! Advance bookings necessary.
475804079,50,"April 15, 2017",Amazing every time,"This is one of my favourites restaurants anywhere. Coming here is more of an event. There are two new chefs and you still get the tasting menu, but now you can read what u are getting before hand! The service as always is very attentive. The food was just sublime. Every course was incredible. A feast for the senses. We also had an incredible red wine that the sommelier recommend. Can't wait to go back!"
475588107,50,"April 14, 2017",Unforgettable,"I heard De Kas is a very good option for dinner but I couldn't imagine it's that good. Food is delicious in a very insteresting location with very kind staff. Reservation is not easy, but It worths. One menu, two options, that's It."
475128413,10,"April 12, 2017","Extremely disappointed, we won't be back.","This place has really gone downhill. We had an extremely disappointing meal last night. After having several fantastic meals there in the past, the disappointment of it not being up to scratch was magnified. I would give it a zero if that was possible. Tiny portions of weed which I could have picked off the sidewalk with a tasteless dressing for the starter. The second dish tasted good but was just like a miniature version of something you might find in the most basic Lebanese restaurant served with a fork in a deep bowl which made it impossible to scoop up the final mouthfuls of what was already a pitiful looking amount. The main was completely unimaginative, again a tasteless sauce and not even cooked properly. The same goes for the dessert. The rhubarb was sour, hard and served with a spoon making it very impractical to eat. Apparently, the concept has changed recently which accounts for the totally different experience to what we had on previous occasions. The waiter tried to compensate with free coffees at the end and after asking for it we also got a free after dinner digestif but this is a small token given the extortionate cost for the overall dining experience. Extremely disappointed, we won't be back."
474755148,50,"April 11, 2017",A wonderful evening's gourmet celebration,"Despite initial hesitation re capacity, four of us sampled six diverse, interesting and quite delicious courses over a couple of relaxing and engaging hours. I would highly recommend a visit to De Kas as a special treat."
473365413,50,"April 7, 2017",Amazing experience!,I loved every bite I tried on the chef's 6 course dinner menu! It was a great culinary experience and the servers made it extra special. The food is what is most memorable and we can honestly say it was one of the BEST dinners we have ever had. A lot of thought was put into each dish and I loved that we could get a peak into the kitchen with the chef working hard.I was in Amsterdam to kick-off my European honeymoon and wanted a special dinner with my husband and they delivered on every aspect! :) The server surprised us with glasses of sparkling wine and a special dessert treat to help celebrate our honeymoon. I'm so glad I was recommended to go to this restaurant and I highly recommend it!!The setting was so different than the rest of the city of Amsterdam that we were exploring . It is located on a green park with its greenhouse right next door. After our meal we walked around to look at the nursery and it was cool to see some of the herbs and veggies that were used in our meal freshly planted.
472843147,30,"April 5, 2017",Pretentious,"The ambiance and setting are very nice in the restaurant. We had 6 dishes menu but we find it pretty weak in terms of taste and originality. The staff is kind but don't know about their wine menu. So after all, it was ok."
472642779,50,"April 4, 2017",Lovely exceptional dining experience,My friend and I were visiting from the US . We were able to book a table for lunch at this amazing farm to table Resturant . We had the pleasure of Zander as our waiter. The food along with the wine pairing and explanationfrom Zander was outstanding . A real FINE treat.
472426321,30,"April 3, 2017",Dinner at an unexpected place,"The location of the restaurant is very tranquil and the decor of the restaurant is really nice and special, because you are actually dinning in a greenhouse, where they even cultivate their own vegetables and herbs, which are also used in the food. When fully seated, it can be a bit loud as it is just one big space with a high ceiling. The service was friendly. They only serve one menu. The dishes had fresh flavors and were not bad, but I expected something more. The wine pairing was not so good, the wines did not go with the food to well, which was a bit of a miss. The price quality ratio is in my opinion a bit off."
471787490,50,"March 31, 2017",Phenomenal meal,"Excellent meal from beginning to end. Very creative ingredient combinations, everything prepared perfectly. Chèvre mousse was one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. Very attentive (but not overly) staff made for a very pleasant evening. Just do not schedule anything for afterwards as it took a few hours."
471123400,50,"March 29, 2017",One of those meals that you remember for a lifetime!,"Without exception, this was the finest meal of our recent European trip, and one of the best meals we have ever had! The setting, in a greenhouse in a park, sets the mood for the evening. The service was friendly and professional. The food was sophisticated and deftly prepared, mostly from the fresh ingredients grown locally (some very locally, in the greenhouse itself!). The wine pairings were flawless. I will always remember the beetroot dish, the mushroom tea, and the goat cheese foam cheese course. It was all truly exceptional. If you find yourself in Amsterdam, do yourself a favour and go to De Kas!"
470870010,50,"March 28, 2017",One of the best meals I've ever had!,"This place is just stunning. The restaurant is in a green house with lots of light and just around the back they grow their very own produce. The food they served us was so fresh and delicious, there's not enough words to describe how much we enjoyed the experience! Something we also absolutely loved is that you didn't get to choose what you were going to have but instead you were surprised with a stunning dish. My friend is vegetarian as well and they were very accommodating. Highly recommended and worth every penny!"
470506705,50,"March 27, 2017",Fine dining in the greenhouse,Had an absolutely fabulous meal at de kas - the setting of the greenhouse was amazing and the service was incredible. Every course was delicious and although a bit pricey worth every penny! We didn't go for the wine pairing but had a delicious Dutch gin with Tonic!It's worth booking at least a month in advance - we were lucky enough to get a cancellation reservation. The menu is set and there is 5 or 6 course options - when you have 5 course the cheese course is usually the one that is left out though we were told if we really wanted the cheese another could be left off. We even got some apples when we left which we're grown in the greenhouse :) it also worth having a little look around the greenhouse afterwards!
469233424,50,"March 21, 2017",Superlative,"We are foodies and this was our splurge while spending a week in Amsterdam. The quality of the food and the sophistication of the preparation was in the top 5 I've ever eaten. The two chefs are new (March 2017) but they arrived from a restaurant that just earned its first Michelin star and I understand why. The restaurant is fixed menu and they grow the majority of the ingredients at their farm, otherwise they source it locally. The service was very efficient, if not necessarily friendly. But I cannot get over how well you could enjoy every spice and every flavor. The dishes were sooooo well balanced."
468725234,40,"March 20, 2017",Amazing evening!,"I decided on ""The Kas"" which is an old greenhouse that has veen converted into a restaurant.The food was amazing and the actual gtounds at night look awe inspiring.Definitely worth a visit.I am only giving them 4 stars as I feel that there is no signage or info to show you how to get o the restaurant with a car. ( we drove around trying to find it- turns out you need to park in the street or take a cab.Other than that an amazing anniversary evening."

We had booked for 19:30 but due to a delayed flight we had to call and push the reservation back over an hour. Considering how busy they were, this was absolutely no problem.The staff and service was absolutely superb right from our arrival. George, in particular, made us feel like old friends. Under his guidance we decided not to look at the 6 course menu until after we had finished our meal. I would highly recommend this as it was wonderful having each course served and really tasting the different flavours and textures. A small gap in between each course allowed us to relax and really take our time to savour the whole experience. What stood out about the food was how fresh, different and delicious it was.When thinking about this restaurant it's more than going out for a meal, it's the full experience that makes it so special.Thank you George and the team."
467345493,50,"March 14, 2017",Amazing food and fantastic staff,"We arrived here on the wrong day of our reservation, couse we written down the wrong date.Luckely we didn't go there for nothing. The staff quickly arranged a table for us at the long table where a couple of 3 with a baby were sitting at the other end.We orderd the 3 course meal and wine parring.All the way through the 3 meals we were possitivly supprised and could only compliment it and went really good with the wine.The dish that supprised me the most was the toast with sardin, spinach and sennep. I must admit im not into sardin or sennep at all and never been a positive experience.But this dish was over all expectations and finished it all.The best dish we had was duck and spinach soup with had a fantastic texture and great flavour.My friend and i ended up getting a tour in the garden. We will definitly come back and even might go for ""Chef's Table"""

467118763,50,"March 13, 2017",The most exciting tasting experience I have ever had,"I cannot say enough good things about this beautiful restaurant - what it offers is an experience, rather than just good food. The tables are inside a lovely large greenhouse, and the setting is spare but beautiful - just perfect to concentrate on the creative and delicious food that comes from the chefs. The waiters are informative, friendly, but not overbearing or pompous, and the food - well, it must be tasted to be believed. Set menus focus on seasonal ingredients prepared in exciting and unusual ways, and the pairing with the wine tasting menu makes an experience you will never forget."
464959758,50,"March 6, 2017",A must do in Amsterdam,"De Kas is an experience in itself. The effect of sitting in a lofty greenhouse is dramatic.However, the standard three course dinner (including the starter which itself consists of three dishes) is also worth going for. Taste, texture, presentation are all top class. We opted for the wine menu and were not disappointed. Really good welcoming and attentive staff."

463552772,50,"February 28, 2017",A fresh take on fresh food,"It's not as central as the other restaurants we went to during our stay in Amsterdam, but the setting is beautiful and worth the extra stops to get there. The greenhouse has been beautifully preserved, and looks like a jewelry box from the outside at night. Some of the food is grown right on the premises (we walked through the working greenhouse to see and even taste the lettuces and herbs growing in the winter), and the rest is grown at their garden just a couple hundred meters away. There are no decisions: the chef makes whatever is growing, in creative, gastronomical ways. It was a real experience and the staff was kind and knows their stuff when it comes to wine."

The menu was pleasing and changes with the season. They accommodated the Gluten Free, Vegetarian and Pregnant family members by asking up front what allergies or dietary restrictions we have.All the food brought to us was outstanding and service almost impeccable - they forgot to bring our wine flight with dinner and had to be reminded. Also one meal which was supposed to be GF had to be brought back as the garnish had Gluten on it. We forgive the wait staff for these minor issues but these mistakes reduced the ratings by a notch!!!Because my family brought gifts, the service realized it was my birthday and brought me a special decorated dessert which was well received."

With tastes that were not revolutionary, which was not expecting to blow your mind, but make you feel that they thought about each part of every plate very deeply. I appreciate when a chef cook wants to feed you, not only showoff.The service was quite regular, the head waiter was a bit petulant."
448936942,50,"January 3, 2017",Ethical excellence!,"De Kas is situated in a park and is essentially a giant glasshouse with smaller glasshouses coming off the side. These smaller structures have the freshest organic herbs and vegetables growing in them. The chicory is grown under dark domed structures. The outer gardens grow spring and summer/autumn plants.BUT! The food?? Exceptional! The menu in really three starters and a main using what is fresh and organically and ethically sourced. The dishes are both beautifully presented and the textures, flavors and combinations put it in the haute cuisine category.If there is still space, indulge and have dessert."

We Enjoyed every bite - and even the apples we got to take home, as we enjoyed our evening stroll back to our hotel. All the produce was beautiful, simple and clean. We enjoyed being explained the origins of the ingredients: sheep's milk cheese, duck, wine etc. Really a treasured experience."

The place is very nice located in a corner of Park Frankendael!, you are literally served in a restaurant of glass, like you are in a greenhouse. There is no menu, the Chef will prepare from you a special dish of the week, that is prepare with the harvest of their organic fruits and vegetables. What I had was just delicious! I cant describe the taste but from the starts to desert all just delicious! You need to visit the place, most of all you knew everything was fresh and just health for your body!"
443015002,50,"December 8, 2016",The future!,"I love this restaurant because they have been pioneering in the way they go about sustainable eating and drinking. Vegetable lead menu's that are sourced from their own green-house first and after that from nearby farmers and growers. If we keep growing the amount of people on the planet and if we keep growing the level of disposable income per person, then we need to find a way to reduce our footprint.The food they serve at the Kas is delicious, changing daily and served in a beautiful environment! It is the example that you don't have to give up anything in terms of experience, taste or quality and still be more mindful.Will definitely come back over and over and will definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!"
442216820,50,"December 5, 2016",Special Thanksgiving dinner at De Kas,"My husband and I were in Amsterdam over Thanksgiving week and I had booked dinner at De Kas. What a charming, delightful restaurant. a bit out of the way, but totally worth it for special dinner. All produce grown locally or in the greenhouses, which you can visit. Set menu with no options, so you have to be adventuresome eater and they will accommodate you somewhat with advance notice. Atmosphere was lively inside but you can still talk without shouting. The wait staff was so professional. Our waiter, Daniel, took such good care of us. A truly memorable meal."
440937700,50,"November 29, 2016",Will change your mind on vegetables.,"You're eating in a greenhouse with vegetables grown from there. It's located in a beautiful park with a storks nest sitting on top of a chimney. Came on a tues alone got a booking from the day before for 7:00pm. Place was half full. Last time we came here we needed to book 2 months in advance. The menu is very different from last time which was just 6 months ago. They only do tasting menu at €49. Three starters, main, and desert. They usually have two mains to choose from. You can order both for another €15. Bread was cold. No butter. Olive oil at the table. They served tap water when asked. Today I had a very tender / moist / fatty guinea fowl breasts served with over a bed of mushroom and sauerkraut. Excellent combination. I suspect it's their pattern in their bird dishes. They cook via Sous vous, then pan fry skin down. The dessert was rhubarb, with frozen rhubarb yogurt and honey comb crumble wafer to sweeten.Service was attentive. They knew who I was.Internet is fast."

An easy walk to the road."
436413439,30,"November 11, 2016",Overrated and Overpriced with Poor Service.,"The location and setting of De Kas is undoubtedly lovely. But the rest of our experience here was pretty poor. The service was terrible, we asked for a vegetarian/pescatarian set menu, and was brought Kale and Black Pudding Soup (the waiter forgot to tell the chef) The replacement kale soup tasted oily. The rest of the food was fine, but nothing special (I can't even remember what it was). This place seems to be style over substance. At the end of our meal we asked for the bill, to which the waitress brought over an empty sleeve. We then had to wait fifteen minutes before we could grab the attention of another waitress, who then also forgot to bring the bill. In total we waited over half an hour to pay, the restaurant was less than half full, and there didn't seem to be any real excuse for such poor service."
435927653,30,"November 9, 2016","Beautiful, unusual but very over-priced","This is an amazing venue with great, efficient and friendly service and very good food (set menu). However, I thought it grossly over-priced. We paid 85 euros each for three smallish courses. Carrot cake for pud...I make that all the time at home! Wines very expensive. Also, difficult to get to. Would not go again."
435886759,40,"November 9, 2016","Lovely Ambiance, Great Food, Sub Standard Service","On our visit to Amsterdam for my 30th Birthday my husband choose De Kas for dinner to celebrate, having had the restaurant recommended to us by friends.Let me say that this restaurant would be a shell of itself if it were not situated so beautifully, the glass house is stunning and at night glittered like a tealight in a hurricane vase – very romantic.The food was good, not excellent, but good, perhaps a little under seasoned and unvaried. Given the breadth of the produce available to the chefs on their weekly fixed menu I was surprised that it all tasted quite similar - there was a distinctive note in each one of the dishes of leafy greens, other flavours, like the slightly bitter toasted walnuts, mineral veal, creamy cauliflower and warm burrata were completely lost in the deluge of fresh greens). The desert though, with the vanilla gelato, was sublime – ice cold but meltingly smooth - conversely the cheese board was again a little same-y – a selection of sharp mature cheeses, I craved a little honey and some mellow soft brie, the quince jelly served on the side was mild but not moreish.Service at De Kas, like the industrial girders, is perfunctory. We waited in reception to be seated. We waited to be served wine. We had to ask what we had been served each course. We waited to get our coats. We waited to leave (hoping that someone might be able to show us around the greenhouse, which I had requested by email one week prior to our reservation – but, we waited and no one appeared, so we left).Would I go again? Hmmmm. Probably not, no. Would I recommend you go? Quite inexplicably, yes, why not, if only to experience a little candlelight flickering off reflective glass, with nothing but inky blackness outside."
435421328,50,"November 7, 2016",A wonderful evening with the family,"We had the most amazing evening here during our weekend break to the city. We took a tram from our city centre hotel which stopped right at the entrance to the park. The restaurant was glowing in the distance as we approached and looked very inviting. The staff were very attentive and informative and we were allowed to enjoy our dinner at our own pace. Each dish was explained to us as it arrived and everything we tasted was sublime. You might think it odd not to be presented with a menu, but we put our faith in their reputation and we were not disappointed at all. The venison dish we had was cooked to perfection and I didn't want it to end! Every table was busy and I recommend making a reservation well in advance if planning to eat here. One of our party had the wine pairing menu too and he enjoyed each and every one! You can see some of the vegetables they use being grown in the greenhouse. Not cheap by any standard, but for a special evening it is well worth the price we paid. All in all, it was a lovely evening and I'd love to visit again next time I'm in Amsterdam."
431535791,40,"October 25, 2016",Such a treat.,"After a short and easy tram ride we arrive to this little oasis just outside of central Amsterdam. The concept is great they grow there own food and cook according to what is in season. It is refreshing to go into a restaurant and the decision of ordering is taken out of your hands. The meal was superb. Service friendly and attentive, presentation gorgeous and food delicious."

429501454,50,"October 18, 2016",Dining adventure,"De Kas is a greenhouse-restaurant in the middle of an Amsterdam city park. The menu is designed to use what's grown in the greenhouse right on the premises, or nearby where the owners have more acreage to grow large quantities of other produce.We enjoyed a fixed-price menu for about 50 euro apiece that included three starters (a beet soup, another dish with a vegetable new to me that was a combination of broccoli and cauliflower, and a salad with a variety of greens). The main course was a fabulous pork tenderloin with small medallion of blood sausage and roasted pumpkin. Dessert was a warm chocolate concoction with a melting center and a dollop of homemade coffee ice cream.Oh, I forgot to mention we started dinner with a gin & tonic, with a gin made on the premises. There are two actually: one infused with cloves and orange and another with chili and herbs. We went with the former gin and liked it so much we had a second round.De Kas is a beautiful setting for a wonderful, memorable meal."

422724278,40,"September 27, 2016",Fancy Veggies,For foodies this is a must place to visit while in Amsterdam. They adhere to the farm to table philosophy for their vegetables and have theirs being farmed on their property where they have several greenhouses.Menus are chef driven based on seasonal vegetables and are available based on your choice for mains or apps. They also have some meat and fish which they source locally so part of your meal will have one or the other.It's definitely on the pricey side but part of the experience is their ability to mix and match the freshest vegetables they have at the time and enjoying them at their peak freshness. If you're not into veggies you may want to skip this one. Good experience but as a carnivore it left me wanting more protein at the end of my meal.
422319709,30,"September 25, 2016",Beautiful place,"We booked a dinner at De Kas during our stay in Amsterdam, based on recommendations of a colleague. De Kas is located in a park, which gets pretty dark at night. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a huge greenhouse and garden. De Kas prides itself for using seasonal vegetables and fruit from their own garden in their menu. We were promptly seated upon arrival, but waited quite a while for the server to come over and explain how the meal works here. The meal itself was not bad but not spectacular. I thought that the main course of chicken breast with seasonal vegetables was quite a boring dish. Also, the chicken was quite dry. The dessert of poached pear with chocolate and granola was pretty good though.Overall, we probably enjoyed the surroundings and tour around their greenhouse more than the food. Not too sure if I will travel so far to try it again the next time."
421918877,50,"September 24, 2016",Pleasant lunch in a greenhouse,"The whole De Kas experience is really wonderful: You walk through a lovely park to get to the restaurant, and then are enticed by the fresh smells the moment you walk in the door. The dining room is radiant with light and life; the food was of the best quality and joyously tasty.Small snafu as my second course never came, which was eventually noted - I decided to just continue with my main course and a portion of my bill was discounted. Aside from this minor thing, an experience to repeat as often as you are in Amsterdam."

414360418,50,"September 3, 2016","Foodies, this is your dream, but...","Ladyfriend and I have been here for multiple meals, and even reserved their large room for our wedding dinner. I will not waste your time describing what this restaurant does, and does phenomenally well -- if you have read even one other review you know that the food is all from their farm or from inside the greenhouse itself, that the menu is redesigned daily, and that you need only announce your preferences to the waitstaff, and they will make it so. All I can attest to here is that the food is, well, just amazing. It's probably too expensive, and if you've read The Dinner by Herman Koch you know the clientele. But I do have one word of advice. Do not, under any circumstances, accept the house cocktail that they offer once you sit down. They're like ten euros and it's a mediocre mimosa. Still, if you;re going have one expensive meal in Amsterdam, this should be it."

Very reasonably priced too considering the quality of the food and service. Highly Recomended
409554242,50,"August 23, 2016",Fantastic Meal,"We ate at De Kas during our recent trip to Amsterdam. This restaurant is truly farm-to-table! They grow all of there own vegetables so it is obvious that they use a lot of vegetables and herbs in their dishes. When you get to the restaurant they will have you sit outside in their gardens until they are ready to bring you inside (They pretty much have only one seating and everyone has the same prefix meal). They will accommodate allergies and dislikes but other than that there is one choice. I really recommend the wine pairings as they are very reasonable 20-27 euros per person, and they pick nice selections for each meal.The meal is four courses and you can also get a cheese course after the entree. We were very impressed with presentation and the quality of the food and wine. The service staff are fantastic and really explain each one of the dishes. The use of fresh vegetables and herbs throughout makes the dining experience outstanding. The night that we were there the meal was 49 euros a piece plus the wine pairing, which is very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food that you receive.This was one of my favorite meals that I have every had and will go again the next time we are in Amsterdam."

We were not disappointed.We started with a nice bottle of bubbly and a tour of the greenhouses by our great waitress for the evening. She was very friendly, fast and just great.Food was outstanding. I love their combinations of fresh vegetables and herbs from their gardens with a twist. Every dish that came out was very well executed and delicious.Add to that an outstanding selection of wines and we had a perfect dinner. I was glad to see that they maintain their high standards after so many years and that a dinner at De Kas is still a special treat.I will for sure be back."
407504394,30,"August 19, 2016",Really nice place but food reviews are overrated,"To be clear - this is good food (!) but is short in terms of price / value proposition. Set menu, little choice to change. Staff was ok, I guess we were unlucky with our service lady. Looked a bit grumpy all the evening ... happens, I guess. For this price you get better places in Amsterdam."

Remote on the edge of a park, across the Amstel river, this little corner of Heaven awaits your visit.The Greenhouse grows most of its vegetables on site.Luckily it was sunny and we ate lunch outside facing the gorgeous flower and vegetable beds edged in boxwood.From the moment you sit down, the gustatory bliss overwhelmed us. The fresh and blended aromas of each course made for an exhilarating experience to be rememberedRun to it, Bike it, Uber it but don't Miss Heaven @ De Kas"
405390591,40,"August 14, 2016",Amazing Greenhouse!,"De Kas is a beautiful restaurant set amid a park with its own site-specific kitchen's garden and greenhouse from where they source some of their berries, greens, herbs and so on, which is indeed beautiful and emphasises on the restaurants culture of local seasonal products, from the wine selection to the actual ingredients in your table. The actual restaurant is inside an amazing greenhouse with a small water feature in front. The interior space is grand and it has a really nice atmosphere with an open kitchen. Overall, the restaurant offers a good experience in terms of food quality, service and quality-price standards."
403865635,40,"August 10, 2016",Delightful treat just outside the tourist area,"fresh, farm to table mystery meals created in an all glass green house that is also the restaurant. Delicious! the garden and green house can be toured as well. We took the tram from outside Centraal Station which too about 20 mins to get there. Different and a real treat.. I enjoyed the element of surprise not knowing what was being served at each stage."

Lovely wine list. Very attentive and gracious service. The setting is very appealing, glass roof, lots of light, sleek furnishings, roomy."

The restaurant is set in a beautiful greenhouse, in the middle of the park… A little out of town, but we uber'd there...no problem.it's a set menu, which changes daily given whatever is fresh. There were beautiful wine choices with every pairing… The service was excellent. I highly recommend this as a special lunch or dinner"
402139690,40,"August 6, 2016",Locally sourced. Delicious food. Unique atmosphere,Dining in an old greenhouse with good climate control makes a very enjoyable and distinctive space. Food is delicious. The menu is set based on season. There is an optional cheese plate which looked delicious but we were too full to sample. Service and presentation were a bit fussy--the waitstaff took themselves. Bit too seriously. The meal was pricey $150 --roughly twice our other dinner expenses in Amsterdam.
401815857,50,"August 5, 2016",Delicious meal in an amazing setting,"Restaurant is in a modern ""greenhouse"" (very similar to the event space in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden in NYC), amidst lovely public gardens. The food is just as good as the setting. Meal is a set 3-course ""surprise"" menu, which we've encountered elsewhere in the Netherlands. They agreed to give me a 2-course (no dessert) for a 9.50 Euro discount. I asked for a small light beer and was given a glass of something very good for 3 euros. The food is consciously healthy and light but portions are ample. Veggies are largely homegrown and delicious. We went outside for the sunset and took pictures. It was a memorable experience."
401504938,40,"August 4, 2016",Casual but Fine Dining!,"Living in San Francisco, there's no shortage of fine dining and casual places -- but De Kas is not really like anything I've seen here or anywhere in recent memory. It's located in a beautiful park, the building is a greenhouse, and the decor is simple and modern. The menu is comprised of a few courses, and we opted for the wine pairing. Each course was delicious, clean-tasting, and representative of Amsterdam (everything was grown on procured onsite or nearby). Even the wines we chose were local! The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and charming. Worth every penny. A lovely experience and definitely someplace I'd return to the next time we're in Amsterdam!"
399768852,40,"July 31, 2016",Nice place for a fresh surprise - yet expensive - meal.,"The restaurant is located in a park, right beside some of the green houses they use to grow the food you will be eating. It can be hot inside if you go on a hot summer day as I did. The service is good but expect to be there for over two hours. There are no menus, they simply bring the food, course after course - you can tell them if you have allergies or dietary needs, but if you are picky with food, this is not a place for you. Our food was good, but we got fish and I am not particularly found of fish, so that was disappointing. The wine selection was good, the cheese amazing. Dessert was average. You can ask for a tour of the green houses after your meal."

398863452,30,"July 29, 2016","Impressive space, not so impressive food",Was in Amsterdam for a short stint and this place came highly recommended. Space is lovely and the concept of farm to table is definitely nice (but obviously not original). I had high expectations of food for freshness and inventiveness and food came up short on all counts. Since menu changes weekly maybe I just came during an off week. The marinated beets were nice but the salad of grilled zucchini and eggplant and lettuce were just okay. Main entree was fish but it was just average in flavor. I'm all for simplicity that highlights food's freshness and I don't think it delivered there either. Don't understand all the hype but maybe they had an off week.
398593786,50,"July 28, 2016",Impressive in every aspect,"From the unique setting right through to the staff's knowledge of what is being served. it is hard not to be impressed by the offering at De Kas.Delicate without being fussy, formal yet relaxed we had a memorable evening meal with a flight of wine.Our server was happy to discuss each course and offered a playful story with each plate that never felt overbearing or stuffy. His English was impeccable - of course far superior to our grasp of Dutch.Happy to accommodate any dietary preferences, bear in mind the menu is created daily. I would recommend dining at De Kas for a taste of something different and memorable."

Super beautiful restaurant, amazing how they turned a green house in a very modern and beautiful restaurant. The service is very friendly and good. They work with a set menu so no hassle with making choices you only let them know if there is something you rather not eat.The food was delicious and very nicely platted.You can walk in through the garden and green house to see the herbs and vegetables they grow locally, very cool to see!Not very cheap but for a specially dinner definitely a place to go to."
397055485,50,"July 25, 2016",Farm to table,Beautiful setting located about 20 minutes out of the main city. They have uber in Amsterdam and it was only a $10 ride Almost all the food is grown on site and was very fresh. The menu is set so you don't have many choices other than to modify. Everything was excellent and the choices made us step out of our usual dishes and try some new things. It was fun for our teenager to try something different- he found out he actually liked the fish they were serving.

396694777,50,"July 25, 2016",Amazing food and atmosphere,Very special evening. It was Earth Hour so it was just candlelight in the restaurant. The food and setting was superb. Amazing memories to last a lifetime.
395942814,50,"July 23, 2016",Amazing Place!,"When my friends picked this place to eat I was very nervous. Firstly, I am a very fussy eater and this restaurant doesn't have any menu options. You just get what you are given. Secondly, there are some foods that just don't agree with me so I was worried about getting ill. Thirdly, De Kas is expensive! I am not a fancy food person and was worried about paying for something I would most likely not eat.As soon as we arrived in the park where De Kas is located I felt like I was in another world. The place is gorgeous and is well worth a trip even if you don't eat in this amazing place.De Kas is fancy and I admit we didn't really fit in but we were treated like all the other guests and there was a welcoming atmosphere.My problems with the food aspect were set at ease when the waiter asked if there were any dietary problems that needed to be considered. We were three non meat eaters which wasn't a problem and my other two main food problems were noted and accepted with no problem what so ever.The food was amazing. Small portions but extremely tasty. I could enjoyed all of it except my main course which had warm/grilled tomatoes which I had to leave, I just hate them warm. No idea why ;) But otherwise it was a joy to eat the surprise menu.Make sure you ask which dessert there is before deciding if you would prefer that to the cheese board. Also make sure you walk through the rest of the greenhouse and see all the fresh produce growing right there. Also make sure you take your credit card or enough cash because the place isn't cheap but it is worth it. Also you really need to reserve!!!Definitely well worth eating here at least once! It was a wonderful experience."
395920261,50,"July 23, 2016",Magical place,"The location of this place is awesome: in a middle of a park, still close to the city center!Go there for dinner, at sunset gets even more magical...Food is very simple and tasty: the quality is in the main ingredients which are grown locally.Looking forward to come back soon!"
395078789,50,"July 21, 2016",Delicious Lunch,"Just returned from a remarkably fine lunch at De Kas (The Greenhouse) in the pretty Frankendael Park on the eastside of Amsterdam.The restaurant is in fact a spacious and airy greenhouse, and it's bordered by its own vegetable gardens (but vegetables are also brought in from their farm just outside the city); garden flowers, too, abound. It's all very spacious and airy inside, and the patio is wonderful as well, shaded and with pretty set tables. Service is quick and efficient but a bit robotic.The park and restaurant (and also the Frankendael Manor restaurant a couple of hundred metres away) breathe tranquillity.De Kas serves only set menus that depend on the produce available. Today for lunch there was a three-plate hors d'oeuvre among which a wonderful cold summer soup of waddenkrab (North Sea Crab). Main course was hake/merlu grilled to perfection. Great dessert with tastes of berries and chocolate. Nice rosé wine, and good espressos to top it all off. All served prettily by pleasant staff."
394340451,50,"July 19, 2016",So charming!,"A lovely sunny day in Amsterdam made the perfect surroundings for a late lunch in this beautiful restaurant. Located a little outside of Amsterdam city center, it has it owns garden and all the dishes have local produce.We went for a set lunch menue with wine by the glass.Our vaitor was very attentive, happy and serviceminded. The food? Supertasty!The vaitor could introduce every dish and served us champagne and rose wine. It felt like a little ""time-out"". On a nice, sunny day - this is a sure winner, it must be one of the best locations in the city. So quiet - in the middle of a large gardenpark, good food and good wine.(And off course they a large seating inside on a rainy day ...)Reservations is recommended. We got to chat a little with our vaitor, and it is always nice to talk with someone who is clearly very proud of where she is working. The food and ambience clearly reflected that during our lunch."
394149919,50,"July 18, 2016",Fabulous!!!,Beautiful atmosphere and delicious food! I highly recommend this restaurant for foodies and special occasions! Arrive early for cocktails on the garden patio!
392850908,50,"July 15, 2016",Visually and edibly delicious,After the chaos of Amsterdam it was a delight to visit the tranquility of De Kas situated in a lovely park surrounded by its vegetable gardens.The freshness of all of the ingredients is a delight for your taste buds on the well balanced and thoughtful set menu.The wine list is considered and has options for most palates and budgets.It was a fabulously relaxing evening during which we were served by knowledgable and attentive staff.Book well in advance so as not to be disappointed.
392505123,30,"July 14, 2016","Expectations high, satisfaction low...","The venue itself is quite a nice place, it is unique and comfortable (we were in the main open room). Only had the choice of a 3 course menu, so you do not get to choose. Food was very basic in it majority, with lots of small plant looking things to make the dish look exciting. For me it was very plain, under sized and overrated ( a small piece of fish for the main). This place is certainly for the people that are foodies and dont mind spending alot of money for a small amount of food in an exclusive environment. The service was good, apart from a long delay in getting our 3rd course. I can see how people would love this place, but its just not my style. An experience for a special occasion for the average person i suspect. Something i certainly would go to the effort of trying again."
392123523,50,"July 13, 2016","great food, great surroundings","We loved our visit at De Kas in Amsterdam. A short trip on out rented bikes to get to De Kas in the middle of a park. We walked around the nursery and the garden, from where the restaurant are provided with their fresh vegetables. The food was perfect and the surroundings matched this wonderful experience. Go there if you are in Amsterdam!"
392074564,30,"July 13, 2016",De Kas didn't live up to our expectations,"Restaurant de Kas offers a menu at a fixed price which is a very good idea and a fine way of letting the chef do his magic and decide the courses from the availability of the produce and ingredients.I don't think it worked, however, the day we visited the restaurant. It was a fine and beautiful day during the first week of July, and I visited de Kas with my husband for dinner around 7 o'clock.For starters, we had parsley soup and after that a dish of mackerel. The parsley soup was a bit bland, I would call it, with a weak taste of parsley and shredded salad in the bowl. Not impressive. The plate with mackerel was a serving of smoked mackerel served on a block of cucumber with some fresh greens around it. I am not sure that smoked mackerel and cucumber do anything good for each other in a culinary sense - at least, in this case they didn't.The main course was chicken served on a bed of salad and some mashed potatoes. There was nothing extraodinary about it. The best thing of the meal was actually the desert which was some fruit based ice cream served with a lovely cream, berries and meringue.The setting in a greenhouse is great fun and the service is impeccable, no doubt about that - mindful and friendly. We ended at a price of 140 euros which isn't bad when you consider what you can end up paying at other culinary establishments. Except, I don't think that de Kas lived up to that kind of expectations that night."

389322511,40,"July 5, 2016",Farm to table - interesting meal,Interesting meal. No menu as they just bring what they grow on site. 4 courses and all flavorful. 45 euro prix fix. Off the beaten path about 15 minutes outside of the city
388930508,50,"July 3, 2016",Unbelievable!,"De kas is a place one has to visit to believe it. The setting is more like a green house. In the middle of a park..We sit amidst greenery. I won't do any justice by saying a few words here. We were a vegetarian group and they made unreal food for us on pre request. Though everyone may not have a pallette for such food,it's still worth a visit."
387657918,30,"June 29, 2016","Good food, just not worth the money","My boyfriend and I enjoyed the 3 course lunch with bottle water, but paid 90 Euros for it. It was good food - light and fresh soup, salad and fish - but certainly not worth 90 Euros. We would have paid 50 or 60 Euros total. It's a unique experience eating in the modern glass structure, and there was great service, but for better bang for the buck, I would eat again at Brasserie Ambassade (where we paid 120 Euros)."
387549272,50,"June 29, 2016","Uniq place, exquisite food",We came for dinner and it was fantastic! From the first course to the last byte of the desert an unforgettable experience. And in my case 100% gluten free

386506136,10,"June 27, 2016",A very very long lunch... it wasn't worth it.,"I went to this restaurant with two friends at lunch. We reserved long time before and we had very high expectation... too bad!The service was awful, very long, we stayed two hours for a very light lunch!We took two menus with three starters each and two main courses to share but the portion are ridiculous! At the end of the lunch we were starving and we didn't have time to order anything else. The food is not a big deal, a starter was composed of three small carrots, that's it! The location is beautiful but the price is very high. It wasn't worth it. Never again."
386192711,50,"June 26, 2016",Really good!,Even been skeptical going to a restaurant with a fixed menu this was a very nice surprise. Great combinations. All they are cooking is seasonal and they change the menu every Wednesday depending of what they harvested the week before. Really creative place.
386157435,50,"June 26, 2016","Fresh, clean, tasty food in each course","For anyone in the mood for a wonderful tasting menu made of obviously fresh, quality food that everyone in the group will want to eat, De Kas is your place! The menu continuously varies on the produce of the day, ensuring a variety of fresh and seasonal vegetables alongside beautiful cooked meats (or of course more vegetables if you chose their delicious vegetarian menu). Food worth its value!"
385667700,20,"June 24, 2016",Ok for an experimental mood..,"I was treated to dinner here by our host company. The service was slow and the food was experimental...dishes are constructed based on ingredients available that day. The waitress, Sophia, found it tricky waiting on a table of English people and so we ended up drawing a table plan with what we would and would not eat on it. She wasn't aware of the drinks available..and they didn't have a drinks menu (they have a wine list) either so the blind were leading the blind. Dishes eaten...awful vegetarian soup like baby food...awful haddock starter with nice beets...overcooked hollandaize new potato with undercooked spring peas (how could you mess this up at this price??)..overdone pork with chorizo, samphire, fried gnocchi and a repulsive anchovy which did not complement the food and an excellent chocolate brownie dessert barring the pickled watermelon. All in all a piss poor experience if you want an honest meal without pretention. I was glad to not have paid and I won't be back."
385064169,50,"June 22, 2016","What a beautiful place, story, and food!","The building and surroundings are beautiful, peaceful and the gardens surrounding are immaculately tended for. The food for lunch is different each day, based on what is growing at the time, and meats or fish are paired with a theme the Chef's come up with each day. For lunch it is a 2 course meal with a small bowl of roasted beats and olives to munch on before the courses begin. The special was a white fish but my husband was also able to have something different as he is not a fan of white fish: they came up with a small chicken and fixed it on the spot for him. The colors, presentation and flavor of all the fresh combinations were excellent. We are recommending to friends to go there. Must have a reservation - apparently dinner needs to be about 3 months in advance but the lunch spaces were there if you go on their website. One of the staff took pictures of the chef's, kitchen and a picture of our dishes that we had for lunch. Super sweet and happy group."
385041257,40,"June 22, 2016",Fabulous space in old greenhouse,"The space is gorgeous and feels very modern and different. As you walk in, you see the beautiful beds of flowers and vegetables they grow at the restaurant. The food is artfully presented and very, very fresh - this is farm to table cuisine which is a very popular and positive trend at the moment. The service was a little slow. We had to ask for bread, and the wine service was slow also, but the servers were friendly and pleasant."

383786273,10,"June 18, 2016","What a disappointment - mediocre food, expensive, impersonal service AND came out hungry","I remember this place from 10 years ago when I visited few times and I remembered it as one of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. Therefore I had really high expectations and oh gosh was I disappointed. We got a set menu with 4 dishes (2 starters, one main and one dessert or a cheese) - the food was just ok, nothing more, portions are extremely tiny and the whole atmosphere was of people coming outside of Amsterdam for a night out. The place had zero atmosphere, everybody got the same food, bad service, even the bread was not tasty... And the most outrageous thing is that we went to a tapas restaurant close by (Pata Negro), as we were still hungry.. Never happened to me that I went to a restaurant, paid 70 Euros per person and came out hungry... (bottle of wine, 2 set menus, and a bottle of water)Don't go there - this place is SO overrated and enjoying still the reputation it had in the past. I am eating out regularly and this was by far the worst experience I had in a long time... Do yourself a favour and find yourself some other place to eat. Amsterdam has many good to excellent restaurants nowadays.. this one is definitely not one of them."
383212189,50,"June 16, 2016",The perfect green restaurant,"From the moment you walk in this place, you smell the freshness of the food. A three course meal with perfect wine pairing this is a must visit. The broad bean soup, the white asparagus and deep fried octopus salad, the Guinea fowl and the amazing watermelon, peach sorbet desert was perfect. It would have been nice if the servers gave more details on the wine instead of just saying this is the wine from so and so country hope you like it! The ambiance was homey and relaxing."
383151913,50,"June 16, 2016",As Good as Ever,"We have been many many times and it is still one of our favorites. a little sad to see the greenhouse areas changed and smaller, but service and food remain the same ; Excellent."

383047454,50,"June 16, 2016",Amazing experience with food,I loved this restaurant for everything. From the amazing food (an explosion of flavors) to the location. The concept of having their own vegetable garden makes the difference in every served dish and you can taste it.
382192118,50,"June 13, 2016",Fantastic food in a romantic location,"I came here for my anniversary dinner three days ago while traveling to Amsterdam with my boyfriend.We got an early reservation so we could continue exploring the night sights of Amsterdam. The whole concept of having no menu was very interesting and new to me and I really enjoyed the surprise of just being brought out food.The wine list was very good - had a nice range of reasonably priced and fancier wines for those who were so inclined. We decided to get two glasses of wine as part of the food pairing - a very nice white and a red that was a hybrid between a rose and a classic red.Each course was something I may not have considered ordering traditionally off of a menu if I saw it but I thoroughly enjoyed every one! Food was beautifully presented and had a great mixture of flavours.The service was exceptional. Everyone seemed to have a very good awareness of what had gone into the food.All in all, for quality of cooking like this and such a beautiful dining experience, De Kas is incredible value for money. We had a lovely evening and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Amsterdam."
381108669,50,"June 9, 2016",Awesome food..definitely recommended !!,Its a very nice place with a unique setup of like greenhouse. Cuisines prepared by fresh food items from their own garden! A must place to visit if you like the chef to satisfy your taste buds! Visited: Feb 2015
381066919,50,"June 9, 2016",A beautiful and unique experience,We loved our lunch at De Kas. Sitting on the patio with a great view of the gardens beyond was a real treat. The staff were great and took time to explain the philosophy and history of the restaurant. The food was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. All in all it seemed like great value and a genuinely unique experience.
380977624,40,"June 8, 2016",Unique setting for a special lunch,"It was a beautiful day to be having lunch on the terrace. Our server explained that the chef had chosen the day's menu for our three course lunch. When we said there were a couple of things we would rather not eat, he assured us the chef would adjust accordingly. The first two courses came fairly quickly and were delicious. Then there was a long wait. We ordered another glass of wine and enjoyed watching the storks who had nested on a nearby chimney feed their young. The restaurant was not crowded....but still we waited. Just at the point that we decided to order coffee and give up on the main course, it arrived. The fish was perfectly cooked and the accompaniments fresh and flavorful.This restaurant is not to be missed. Just be ready for a leisurely unique experience."
380897503,40,"June 8, 2016",Delicious fresh food but quite expensive,"Took my son here as a treat today. The menu is decided beforehand, fortunately they ask if there is anything you don't like. The portions were a good size and we felt full. Some interesting food combinations. However the gin and tonic was a horrendous price, do not have mixed drinks! The service was excellent and the situation lovely and different. The park is great to walk through afterwards and see the local allotments. It was quite expensive but not ridiculously so considering how much we had paid in other 'ordinary' restaurants."
380772462,50,"June 8, 2016",Fresh and refreshing,"We caught a No 9 tram from Centraal Station to the front door. It was a brilliant Spring day and on arrival we were offered a table outside the glasshouse, adjacent to the hedged vegetable garden.

It took about an hour and a half to go through the meal, with wonderful service and even though it was drizzling, the views were lovely through the glass walls.

We had a wonderful lunch with fresh vegetables and were happy to see they could accommodate a (tasty) vegetarian option. Food varies and the menu is based on what is seasonally grown in their garden. Lots of light, and airy atmosphere. Reservations (for lunch at least) seemed to fill up quickly so I would check a few days in advance to ensure you get a spot!"

The tasting type menu is provided for you in courses , they only ask what you cannot eat or any allergies then you must submit yourself to a sublime experience of the freshest herbs, vegetables grown right there at the greenhouse Each course is the right delicate amount to surprise your tastebuds. They will offer wine selections to go along with each course. This is a true foodie adventure. When they offer a handmade cheeseboard with dried fruits and nuts as dessert, I am in heaven! A must do experience for the food adventurer!"

Unfortunately, this time around, the set menu had a terrible soup, mediocre salad, and a slice of pork that could have been mass produced for a cafeteria style meal. The ""couldn't care less"" server announced the pork as veal. One of us preferred fish and the same bland sauce was poured on both. Couple all this with ordinary wines and high prices and you have a pretty terrible experience. Really. De Kas has simply turned bad."
373824185,50,"May 17, 2016",I really like this restaurant,I have eaten here for about 8 years ago (last time in Amsterdam) and wanted to try it again while visiting the city. And it was a good choice. It was still as good as I remembered it. The staff is laid back and friendly without getting to close. The dishes were very tasty and felt fresh (probably because of the fact that there was a lot of fresh vegetables). I also didn't find it that expensive. I have eaten at other restaurants where you'd get one dish for the same price as a 5-course dinner here and those restaurant has not been nearly as good.Don't have any complaints what so ever. Will definitely come back here when I'm in Amsterdam next time.

The menu changes everyday and is based on what is fresh that day and what the chef feels like cooking and presenting.You really don't have a say in the matter but it really doesn't matter because everything was delicious. Well prepared, well seasoned and well presented.A bit pricy but worth it."

My boyfriend and I were visiting Amsterdam and made a reservation here. We both had the chef's menu, which offered fresh ingredients in reasonable portions. But overall, the food was a bit bland. It certainly wasn't worth the ~$150 tab."

The welcome is warm and friendly and care is taken to explain the restaurant's formula: a surprise menu of four or five courses although you can, of course, mention any foods you can't eat. Vegetables and herbs are grown in their own gardens and the menu was Iight, fragrant, tasty and healthy. Good advice on accompanying wines. We loved it. Need to book well in advance to secure a table."

Before it came we received a small dish of olives and marinated celery root and mushrooms. We were there less than 10 minutes when the first course arrived. I could tell it was not going to be a leisurely lunch. The white asparagus soup was very good and nicely presented. While I was in he bathroom, they served the salad. I have never heard of a plate being served when the person has left. The rest of the meal followed suit. They tried to remove my husband's dish while he was in the bathroom, and I was still eating. So much for a leisurely lunch. By the way, they did not ned the table."
370097498,50,"May 4, 2016",Such a delicious meal at De Kas,"We ate here on our first night in Amsterdam and it was tip top. It's a really cool building, literally part of the greenhouse where much of their food is produced. We were able to have a little look around the produce before sitting down to eat. The food was really inventive and we treated ourselves to the accompanying flight of wine. All food was presented by knowledgeable and friendly staff. Although it's quite a high end restaurant, the vibe is very relaxed. A must go for foodies travelling to Amsterdam!"
367981263,50,"April 26, 2016",Fantastic!,"After reading many restaurant reviews in advance of a brief stay in Holland, my wife and I selected DeKas for our first dining experience in Amsterdam and our expectations were exceeded.The beautiful restaurant is located within a large, contemporary greenhouse and is surrounded by a pretty park. Just a short tram ride (#9) from Centraal Station, DeKas is easily accessible from anywhere in the city.The gorgeous surroundings enhanced an amazing chef's menu of fresh, delicious appetizers, entrees and desserts. Each course was expertly prepared, with dishes that were too beautiful to eat. The fresh, locally sourced ingredients combined for a most flavorful meal. The wine list provided many good options and the service was exceptional. Every member of the staff was courteous, professional and very proud of their restaurant.We've enjoyed many great meals in Europe and highly recommend DeKas to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience."

Fact, the Maître D even remembered it before we could mention it...Still recommending De Kas to our friends visiting Amsterdam and no one was disappointed of their visit.Again, congratulations to De Kas of keeping up the quality and the friendliness.Can't wait to come back!"

Go with friends or someone fun to keep it from getting too stuffy as the locals clearly think it's a bit of high spot and are all well turned out and a tad formal. Fortunately, the venue is big, bright contemporary and really stylish.All their food is grown either within their greenhouses, or on their farm or locally. And it's al about what's ripe for picking. The combination of flavours are fab. You get what you're given so you just have to go with the flow.The food is vibrant and full of freshness, which really pop, even the greens, local arugula, micro herbs, are lively on the tongue.And I've never enjoyed rhubarb so much.It's refreshingly different, great for an occasion, as top end price point but really worth it."

We enjoyed the lunch there. Spacious. Friendly and efficient service. Food presentation and taste were both good. I think diners get the most out of the glass house ambiance at lunch but I have not eaten there at night. Two set lunches and two glasses of wine cost Euro 90.8. Recommended."

363178737,30,"April 10, 2016",Disappointing,"Although the restaurant setting is lovely in a converted green house in a park setting, we were disappointed in the food which is grown in the restaurant greenhouse.

From beginning to end it was a very special meal that we will always remember and talk about. Each dish was explained in detail and tasted amazing. Although you are asked if there are any foods you don't like, you don't actually choose your dishes from a traditional menu but are served the very best, in season produce. I loved this idea and it meant that I didn't spend the evening wishing I'd chosen the dishes my husband had picked! The food was beautifully presented and was absolutely delicious. The staff were attentive but not stuffy and were happy to answer any questions we had. It is a little way away from the centre of Amsterdam but easily reached by a 20 minute tram ride or taxi. It was a unique experience and we will definitely go back next time we're in Amsterdam."
362006752,50,"April 6, 2016",My Kind of place,"An ideal restaurant to me: interesting and delicious food, attentive and friendly service, no arrogance, comfortable setting, reasonable price. De Kas delivered on all of these. We had a great evening experiencing taste combinations we have never experienced, enjoying the climate-controlled greenhouse setting, and being made to feel very welcome. We made reservations well in advance and I am glad we planned for this dinner. Most definitely worth a special trip. Be aware there is no menu - you eat what they are preparing. No complaints here. Five enthusiastic stars,"

359608710,50,"March 29, 2016",Wonderful lunch,"We had a wonderful lunch here. De Kas serves home-grown, in-season vegetables, which are the star of the show. Our set menu did contain some fish, but the focus is obviously on the veggies.Whilst there isn't a menu to choose from (it's a blind set menu), the staff went out of their way to accommodate a food allergy, with really incredible substitutions. We were also asked if we had any food dislikes - so I don't think anyone would really struggle to eat here.The meal started with tiny plates of pickles, and bread, to share. We then had a bowl of delicious onion broth, followed by roasted vegetables in a nutty dressing, and bulgur wheat with clam. The main was fish with root vegetables, in a herb sauce. We had cheese (all Dutch varieties) and then an incredible raw chocolate brownie for dessert. We opted for the matching wines and we weren't disappointed. I'd especially recommend the Dutch sparkling wine.We found the staff to be fantastic. I had mentioned it was my partner's birthday, when booking, and they certainly made it feel like a special occasion. The service was great. The kitchen also iced the dessert plate with a birthday message, which was lovely and unexpected. The dining space has a great ambience, in the daytime.Sadly, the weather was awful, so we didn't get the chance to look around the park/gardens, but it was nice to be able to look in the greenhouses, on the way out.I'd certainly return here. The food was great, the staff were lovely - and helpful - and I'd love to see what it is like in the summer."

We went here on the back of a 10 day holiday to the carribean and have to say in all honesty I have had a lot better. Waiters were pleasant enough but very stiff. Really did not get this and our teenage kids had McDonald's after as even the pasta kids meal really did not cut the mustard. If you want a great location to meet with friends this is the place. The rest is just a little to pretentious for our tastes.
357929099,50,"March 23, 2016",Brilliant Experience,"This was a Birthday meal for my partner and our first time eating at a restaurant with a fixed menu. Was a little dubious to start with but felt completely at ease once the waitress had talked us through what to expect that evening.We really enjoyed 2 out of 3 starters but that was due to personal taste of not being fans of fennel. The main was delcious. We followed this with a cheese platter - as suggested by the waitress prior to our dessert on which the chef wrote 'Happy Birthday' on the plate which was a nice touch.We had the table from 8 until about 10-ish and were not rushed or pressured at any point.The Greenhouse itself is beautiful both inside and out and we had a fabulous experience, made all the better by the friendly and efficient staff!Would recommend for a special occasion."

Service: Self important server who assured us they are almost full most nights for dinner delivered water and then wandered around speaking with the other server and kitchen staff for almost fifteen minutes before returning. Only one choice of first course/main course. Server did not tell us about alternatives which we heard other server (who seemed to be nicer) telling the only other table in use. We asked our server for an alternative at which she took umbrage, grudgingly said that would be possible and finally after I said could not eat the offering agreed with great reluctance. The food: great lettuce and micro greens, fair turnip grown in their own green house and garden. The guinea hen and perch on the other hand, were pedestrian: dull and overcooked. Another preciously narcissistic organic with mediocre cuisine not worth the tram ride much less the menu price."

The chef only uses fresh and seasonal products and grows his own vegetables in: De Kas = (greenhouse)The food was very tasty, and the presentation lovely. Three small starters, very delicious and a main course. Mine was vegetarian, my friend took fish. Everything on the plate was eatable , even the flowers and it was all great. The dessert was the same for both of us, tasty too. But my favorite was my main dish (photo with flowers on the place)."

352132528,40,"March 1, 2016",What a lovely way to spend a lunch!,We had a lovely Friday lunch sampling the tastes of Des Kas. They were fully accommodating to my food intolerances and the food didn't suffer in flavour because of this. The whole concept is great and the service alongside was as well. It wasn't too expensive for the type of food and service you got therefore for value for money I think that it was on point.

The environment in the restaurant also adds something very special to your dining experience. Their range of vegetarian food is better than almost every restaurants which is appreciated by us vegetarians. This was by far the best meal we had in Amsterdam and I really recommend this restaurant.
350164102,50,"February 22, 2016",Nice dinner,"This was an interesting place and just as described - even offering a small tour of the greenhouse. It is not an a la carte restaurant as it only offers 3 courses of local sources food available that day. All three of ours were delicious - soup for starter, then two small dishes of roasted fennel in filo and the other mushroom, turnip and purees. The main dish was cod with roasted, pickled and pureed carrot. Yummy! We then had a lovely set of cheeses. We opted for the wine pairing and had lovely and interesting wines with each course. The place was big but had a nice hubbub atmosphere. An added bonus is that it is right next to the No. 9 tram stop."
350046219,40,"February 22, 2016",out of the ordinary,"In this unique location was treated to dinner by my daughter. An excellent idea of home-grown, locally sourced ingredients. The fixed menu was explained in great detail and took into account my 2 allergies. Excellent taste and unusual presentation and preparation (dried crispy vegetables, mushroom broth like no other).However, we did feel that we did not get total value for money coming in at approx. 75 euros a head. First of all some of our group were still a little peckish even after the set courses. Another downside was the service, it starts off too enthusiastically and then tends to die down the nearer you ge to bill time. We had to ask 2 waiters and wait 20 minutes for the bill.In summary, interesting cuisine yes but not worth the expense"
348738154,50,"February 17, 2016",Delicious and unpretenti,"A group of us had lunch here, some of the group were vegetarian, and others were not. Everyone had a fantastic meal!The restaurant is set in a glasshouse, they grow most of the produce they use and the staff explain each dish as its being served.The food was outstanding and the service was friendly, fluid and unpretentious - we all loved it!"
348464394,40,"February 17, 2016",Healthy eating,"De Kas is a little way out of the centre of Amsterdam, but easily accessible by taxi or the number 9 tram. It is situated in a beautiful large, high-ceilinged conservatory, surrounded by home grown vegetable and herb plants. There is a set menu every day of 2 or 3 courses, or just 3 starters if you would prefer. The flavours in each dish are complex and unusual. Beetroot features quite a bit (very healthy!) The portions are small, but we were pleasantly satiated by the end of the meal. You can opt for paired wines, or choose from the wine list. This is an experience worth indulging in."
348253748,50,"February 16, 2016",Unforgettable Experience!,"I booked the Chef's Table during my honeymoon for my wife and I. It was the last dinner on our European trip and it could not have ended any better. From beginning to end, the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a great time. We had a private table in the kitchen where we were able to watch the kitchen prepare food the entire night. Each chef took a few minutes to present and explain each dish they prepared for us (10 courses too!!). We also were provided wine pairings throughout the night that made it even more fantastic. At the end of our meal/experience (5 hours - but it flew by because of the great time), the head chef gave us a tour of this lovely restaurant and their philosophy behind their creations. They create menus weekly and always use fresh local ingredients, some of which are grown right at the green house. Overall a fantastic experience and I would highly recommend De Kas to anyone looking to have a romantic, informative, and fun experience. Book the Chef's Table! It won't disappoint."
347461801,40,"February 13, 2016",perfect for summer lunches,"So, in all honesty, I had heard so much about this place that I went in with very high expectations. And it did meet quite a few.Food - The food is fresh, creative and delicious. You can tell how fresh and lovely the produce is, given that they grow it themselves. Full 10 points for the food.The service was attentive and quite good too.Where it fell short was the vibe of the place. We went on a friday night and I was expecting warm, lively evening but the place was a little empty and the decor was a litte off with pink and blue lights and the ambience didn't feel cozy and warm for a winter dinner.Would I go here again - yes! but only to see how it is in the summer. I can imagine how it can be perfect for summer lunches and even dinners but it didn't cut it for a winter warm cozy romantic evening."

346330096,50,"February 9, 2016",Ubelievable tasting food!,"Very interesting venue (yes, in a working greenhouse) and the food was incredible. Clearly, they are experts at serving vegetables they grow but everything was really good."
345099335,40,"February 4, 2016",Super Average...,"I know, I know, they grow some of their own produce and De Kas is located in a wonderful green space, bla, bla, bla... The soup was super. The rest was super average. We ordered the set 5 course. They served the main straight after the first course. They tried to make up for it by serving us a cheese platter after the main, but got that wrong as well by serving a portion for one not for two. They swapped the cheese platter before my dinner date returned to the table. They did not charge us for our ""off the list"" wine in an attempt to make up for an otherwise average experience. Even with the hiccups aside, with the exception of the fresh soup De Kas serves average dishes. Don't believe the hype."
342601265,50,"January 25, 2016",Farm-to-Table Extraordinaire,"De Kas, which means greenhouse in Dutch, is an absolute treat. When they say farm-to-table they mean it; you'll enjoy your meal in a greenhouse that serves as part of the facility where they grow all the vegetables you will eat. The food is beyond fresh, if that's even possible, and the flavor of everything is unadorned with sweeteners, salts or fats. No menu, which may seem odd at first, but also simplifies the choices you have to make. Sit back and let them bring out delicious and healthy foods that will continue until you are full. Oh, you can select your beverages of choice before, during and after your meal."

I just returned for the food :)"
341838513,50,"January 21, 2016",Innovative,"We loved our dinner at this restaurant. I would usually avoid anywhere that has a fixed menu, but took a gamble on this one. I am very pleased I did as the food was excellent for both vegetarians and others. The service was great and the cost was reasonable. It was also very interesting to see the greenhouse where much of the food was grown."
341317615,40,"January 19, 2016",dinner with family,Fantastic setting inside a huge glass orchard inside a charming private park.You arrive by a short path in the middle of trees and water ponds.Inside there is also a nice chimney fed with wooden pieces stored along the wall.Quite elegant yet not formal.
341168206,40,"January 19, 2016",Experimental - enjoyable,"In a greenhouse - a 10-15 min taxi ride from the center - this was a visit to a restaurant recommended by family members - recommended for its approach to short travelled food.. We had the set menu (the only one) - 4 courses, - with matching wines. - the wines were a mixed experience - after a quite surprising good sparkling Dutch Riesling before the meal - we had other locallly produced wines - some not up to the standard and matching the quality of the food we expected. Service and ambiance were great, and the restaurant must be a wonderful place in the springtime - in the middle of the park.."
339630990,30,"January 13, 2016","""Not quite what we expected sadly ...""","After much hype about this restaurant , we were excited at the prospect of a interesting meal created with care from the green house garden and locally sourced products .However this was not ot be the case fo us , we dined for dinner , friendly service team seated us and explained the concept of De Kas , a 3 course set menu for 49.50 euros plus , plus plus , we decided on the wine pairing to complement the menu , a further 27.50 per person.First course was a earthy clear mushroom soup with a foam so the soup looked like a ""frothy beer"" , quite bitter in taste however palatable .Second course was a salad of green house greens poached salsify , crisp vegetables , lightly smoked piece of salmon with a red pepper and galric dressing , this course was very pleasant to the palate and enjoyed by all .Second plate was a salad of winter cabbage , caramelised pear , blue cheese on a crostini of walnut bread , a strange combination of crisp fried cabbage , blanched cabbage , sweet pear and tangy cheese , mmmm different.......Main course was a juicy guinea fowl breast set on Champ potatoe , brocolli flowers , braised endive and poached rhubard , and a guinea fowl jus .I was not taken by the range of the different flavours , too many that just did not marry together , the red wine did not pair well at all , too young and hard on the palate .We chose the cheese platter of 3 Dutch cheeses apricots and a syrup , walnut bread ,the portions of cheese were so miniscule , it came as such a suprise to see how much lack of love and attention to detail .....Dessert was a apple tart tatin filled with marzipan, paired with a egg nog ice cream , no caramel sauce from the baking process leaving the dessert somewhat unappetising.Overall we found the food / dining experience less than optimal for a restaurant with so much standing in the city , sadly it lacked the WOW effect, which we did not expect after reading up on the internet about it."
339288881,50,"January 11, 2016",My favourite restaurant in Amsterdam,"I keep getting drawn back to this place. The food is fantastic. All natural ingredients, produced on site or at one of their local farms. The menu is fixed depending on what in season but in the many times i have been there, i have always been impressed. They can cater if you have any allergies or dislikes just make sure you tell them. Great venue for either a date or business dinner."
337970198,20,"January 6, 2016",Boring food,"We went to this restaurant expecting something great...which unfortunately didn't happen.The setting is very nice, the waiters are polite but the food is just far beyond disapointing. No taste, no originality, tiny portions... Just plain boring.Thanks God the bread and wine were good.Other restaurants in Amsterdam offer a far better food for less."
337589704,40,"January 5, 2016",Go here it's worth it,This is fine dining with organic ingredients. They grow their own food if you like it fresh and tasty then it's worth making the visit to the park. Not cheap but worth it.
336952572,20,"January 3, 2016","Absurd price, affected waitress, terrible food","OK, so I am probably the only negative review here so now you're all reading!To begin, I am a Bay Area foodie so the whole schtick appeals to me- locally sourced, carefully crafted to let the simple flavors of the foods themselves shine. I get it. It's like all we do around here.This missed. There was not one thing I ate that tasted good.The host was superb- energetic and more helpful than he needed to be.The greenhouse is cool. The space was beautiful and comfortable- remarkable in the crappy winter weather.But.Oh wait! I liked the wine!The waitress literally had her nose in the air. She was not attentive or helpful in selecting wines or explaining the menu.The food was flaccid and tasteless. I know. Flaccid is not usually a descriptor for food. But there you have it. It perfectly describes the terrible meal.That said, everyone else loves it so I imagine you could have a good meal there. But, I eat out a LOT and this was probably my worst meal of 2015."
336626998,30,"January 2, 2016",Valid experience,"The restaurant was highly recommended and we decided to try, it is far from the city center and its in the middle of a park, a very beautiful place. The experience was good, but I think it's not a place I would come back in another time at Amsterdam."
336614139,40,"January 2, 2016","Really nice setting, good food","We had tasting menu for 5 which was generally quite good. Veggies and salads really fresh and tasty grown on the property. Guinea Fowl which was our main course was very good, wonderful flavour and quite tender. Plenty of food for a tasting menu. Service generally excellent. Help with the wine was very high level and spot on with each course. The highlight unquestionably however was the setting. Really gorgeous Reno of the greenhouse in the park, and when the tables were all ""dressed up"" for evening dinner service it was kind of magical. I would recommend it as a special night out, but be prepared to spend for the experience."
336494080,50,"January 1, 2016",A must do if in Amsterdam. Exceptional.,"This is one of those restaurants that make you want to return to Amsterdam over and over again.Well, that, the Van Gogh Museum and the great, ahem....cafes.Built in a kwekerij, or greenhouse - the setting of windows, light, indoor and outdoor trees, wide open, gleaming floors and a huge, vaulted glass ceiling - the dining area itself is something to behold and a beautiful place for dinner, the building being in a wooded lot across a bridge next to a canal.The food changes every night, you get three courses and they are always based on what is in the garden, what is in season and how well they do and do not pair together. While I could describe that our set three course menu with amuse bouche in between and a wine pairing if you chose it - was incredible - the one theme we found in the three times we have visited is the ingredients. Whether red or white meats, sprouts, turnips, beets and carrots in winter or peas in warmer weather - each ingredient has been ridiculously good, like - these are the best carrots I ever had, or these are the best roasted beets I have ever had, best pea soup I have ever had, etc, etc. Every dish/course we have had has been very, very good and impeccably prepared.One bonus I have come to enjoy is not knowing what is for dinner, just the anticipation that it is likely going to be more than f...ing awesome."
334638379,40,"December 23, 2015","Very nice discovery, both restaurant and part of town","We went for lunch and it was just wonderful.The location : in a park without cars in the East part (Watergraafsmeer) of Amsterdam.The staff : very friendly, young and welcoming.The food and the price / quality were good, as was the extensive wine list. We enjoyed a two course meal, a vegan version for me, with mostly local vegetables and home-made sourdough bread. 2 appetizers and a nice green tea to end (with some vegan black chocolates). All in all a very nice afternoon. We'll be back for a full dinner experience."
334190279,50,"December 21, 2015",for special occasions,"De Kas is a high quality food and well designed restaurant, located in Amsterdam-oost, in the middle of a park.Food was tasty, well decorated, and made good use of fresh materials.In spite of the pompous potential, atmosphere is not heavy, and service is friendly.Be ware that the high quality adjoins high prices...."
333224866,30,"December 15, 2015",A rather disappointing meal,"Most of the reviews of De Kas (in guide books and on the internet) say that it is a wonderful restaurant. I'm afraid that we don't agree. To our mind, the food is pretty unadventurous, and the service below what you should get in a restaurant of this calibre.The menu is 'a secret' - you simply tell them what you don't like - which is fine in theory but the food that we were presented didn't live up to the hype of this secret. We got the feeling that they are resting on their laurels somewhat, and perhaps the number of corporate customers eager to entertain here means that they don't need to try quite so hard.We started with a soup of celery with leeks and a garlic foam - this was the possibly the best thing we had, though the garlic rather overwhelmed the other flavours. Next came two different things - one for each of us: a lobster tail (unexceptional) and venison (unspectacular). They did not ask us which we would prefer, and they were not dishes you could share, so this too was rather disappointing. The main course was pork but was not very excitingly prepared. The dessert was a sort of tiramisu, made with beetroot and coffee. It was tasty, but not enough to raise the whole meal to the expected level.Yes, the vegetables are all extremely fresh, and the meat all locally sourced, but the cooking of them didn't reach the heights you would expect of a top restaurant.The conservatory dining room is a very lovely space, but we found the staff not particularly helpful or attentive.All in all, I booked this restaurant expecting it to be the best meal we had during our 5 day trip to Amsterdam. Sadly, it was not - what a pity. A school report would say: Could do better!"
332985833,40,"December 15, 2015",Great restaurant,"Went to eat here with friends on a recommendation and must say was not disappointed. There was a story behind each course which the server explained, simply a great experience with fantastic food and drink.."
331836546,50,"December 10, 2015",The best meal of my life.,"There aren't enough ways I can praise this restaurant. I've eaten everywhere- from holes in the wall to Michelin star restaurants and this was easily the best dining experience of my life and I can't imagine it will ever be topped.We booked the chefs table months in advance not really knowing what was involved but excited to try it out. We had several dietary restrictions that we notified them of which were easily accommodated. We arrived at 7pm and were escorted by the chef to our table. I assumed we would have three or four courses with wine and be out of there in a couple of hours. How wrong I was! We had 11 courses of the most amazing food we had ever tasted which were paired with 11 wines that were mind blowing.Each chef in the kitchen would take turns preparing a special dish for us that wasn't being served to the rest of the diners in the restaurant. They would deliver the dish themselves to our table and go into great detail about what they had prepared. We loved watching them prepare the dishes and then hearing about what went into creating these masterpieces. When I thought about dining in the kitchen I expected a loud atmosphere full of stressful staffers. This kitchen was so impressively calm and organized. In addition to the amazing attention we received from the chefs, the sommelier was also excellent at pairing wines for us and giving us the utmost attention.In addition to the amazing food and service we were also treated to a tour of the property including the greenhouse. We loved learning the history of the restaurant and appreciate how De Kas was doing farm to table way before this movement started becoming popular.This dinner ended up being a five hour affair and we were in complete heaven the entire time. We have decided next time we travel to Europe we will fly into Amsterdam just so we can have dinner there again before heading to our destination.Thank you so much to everyone at De Kas for making this an experience I know we will never forget and will be talking about for years to come."

330905658,50,"December 5, 2015",Wonderful setting and lovely ambiance,Excellent standard of food and service here. The three of us enjoyed the set menu and wine pairings that were offered.I was surprised how reasonable the prices were. For food and ambiance of this calibre in other large cities I would expect to pay twice as much.I would love to visit this place in the spring ashen we visited here in the late fall it was too dark outside to appreciate the beauty of the surrounding park.
330876110,30,"December 5, 2015",disappointed,"We were recommended by a fellow traveler to this highly rated restaurant. After a 70 Euro taxi ride we had a just average meal for an exorbitant price. The service was over the top, the interior stark but not a Michelin experience."
329740282,50,"November 29, 2015",Superb food and staff!,"This restaurant is located in an enormous greenhouse that at one stage belonged to the Council of Amsterdam and that is located in Park Frankendael in the east of Amsterdam. All fresh ingredients are either from their own nursery or are sourced from local farmers, growers. The food is just stunning, we have been coming here for lunch with family and friends from England for about 6 years and have loved the experience everey time, Lunch is 3 courses, soooo delicious, and the staff is well trained, delightful, speak fluent English, but above all they are so knowlegdeable, they must have had excellent training. De Kas i.e. The Greenhouse, is surrounded by fruit trees and vegetables plants which arrive at your table, picked a few hours earlier. We love it!!,"
327989986,50,"November 20, 2015",Beautiful restaurant with great farm-to-table food,We went here our last night in Amsterdam and it was amazing. And so well priced -- the equivalent meal would have been 3X the price. We had the 3 course plus the matching wine flight - defintiely worth it.
327439187,50,"November 17, 2015",A different kind of healthy dinning,A must visit restaurant away from the touristic scene.A modern concept of what a traditional home-made cuisine should be. A very original presentation twisted with a delicious delicates mix of flavors where exotic vegetables are the main attraction of the whole meal journey. I will definitely return on my next trip.
326847543,30,"November 15, 2015",Lacking flavour and imagination,"Most expensive restaurant we have visited in Amsterdam and not the best by a long way. Doesn't really make the best of the lovely fresh herbs and vegetables. Nothing really brings out the intense flavours and some of the non-vegetable ingredients are not the best.Lovely setting and well planned dining area, but needs a spark. Doubt we'll come back, we have our favourites and De Kas has not changed our minds. Disappointed."
326619873,50,"November 13, 2015",Amazing dining experience,"I reserved a table for two for dinner and requested for a quiet spot in the restaurant, the staff replied my email personally, which I think is a very nice touch to the whole experience. I also requested to them to write a message on my date's dessert plate and it was nicely arranged and executed.Since it was our first visit, our waiter told us the story of the restaurant and made sure we were comfortably seated. The sparkling white wine produced in Limburg that our waiter introduced me when I opted for champagne tasted heavenly. The food was exquisite, as expected from De Kas's menu which differs everyday according to what kind of fresh produce they have for that day.The ambience of the restaurant was nice, the waiters were very attentive as well, food was really good. In a nutshell, a must visit in Amsterdam. I'll be heading back for more!"
326106734,50,"November 11, 2015",A real treat,"The food was delicious and the atmosphere wonderful. There is no menu so choosing your meal is easy. I recommend a reservation though. We loved every part of our meal but since the menu changes daily there is no reason to explain each course. I will say the ""caprese salad"" dessert was amazing and a roller coaster of flavor. After eating you can walk through the greenhouse where a majority of your meal was once growing."
326018474,50,"November 11, 2015",Great lunch!,"Loved our lunch at De Kas. It is a bit of a walk from the centre but definitely worth it. De Kas, which means “greenhouse” in Dutch, takes farm-to-table to a whole new level. You sit in the middle of a large greenhouse and nearly all the vegetables you eat have been produced just a stone’s throw away. The meats are sourced from local farmers, too. And the food was wonderful, light and full of flavor. A walk through the herbal and vegetable garden later on just nicely completes the entire experience."

You just have to let go and see what the chefs will cook that night. On the evening our party attended, I was a little disappointed by some dishes: the soup and dessert were fantastic. I am not a big fan of razor clams (second course) but it was fine of course. The main dish (pork) was good, but on the whole the food was not the most memorable part of the evening; the setting was."

323919657,50,"November 2, 2015","Amazing meal, amazing setting!","Definitely one of the best meals I have eaten, certainly this year. The unique setting of an old, renovated greenhouse, slightly outside the centre, is beautiful. The service is perfect. A no choice 3 course menu started with a richly flavoured celeriac soup, followed by 2 starters using vegetables grown by the restaurant, including a delicious dish with 3 types of beetroot and oxtail. The main course was a fresh water fish, perch, with a salsa and again, superlative vegetables including artichokes. Dessert was a white chocolate cake with a caramelised slice of pear and pear sorbet. Fresh and seasonal is the order of the day. We opted for the wine flight which was very well chosen, including a dessert wine and was very good value. The restaurant was packed and reservations are recommended. Super bread too and they offered you an apple to take with you as you left. Memorable."

322335765,50,"October 27, 2015",The freshest food and the cleverest cooking.,"This is a truly exceptional restaurant. Located a short journey beyond the city centre in an area not visited by many overseas tourists, you have to make a bit of an effort to get here, but if you do then you will be rewarded handsomely. You eat in a gigantic greenhouse, which has been fitted out with striking, stylish furnishings, and the atmosphere is unlike almost any other restaurant. They offer only a set menu (although you can alert them about allergies and similar things when you book) and all the ingredients are locally grown and sourced. Freshness is a priority, and our meal contained some of the most tasty and excellently cooked vegetables you can imagine. Meat and fish are treated with similar care, craft and skill. Among the exceptional dishes were a celeriac, endive and lovage soup, slow-roasted veal with pickled mushrooms and a trio of beetroots, seared fillet of perch with potato rosti, pak choi and pumpkin seeds, and a cheese board of the highest quality. Service is impeccable. This is a restaurant that really cares about food and expects its customers to do the same. Go on, leave the city-centre tourist traps behind and take yourself here for a gastronomic treat."

This makes a great spot for foodie photographers everywhere. First of all, I enjoyed the olives and the mint tea before the start of our meal. The olives were absolutely delicious and the mint was extremely fresh and fragrant. We started off with a celeriac, endive based soup which was very creamy. Then we had the beef brisket, which wasn't my favourite, but I still enjoyed it. The beet salad with the chestnut mousse was well put together as well. I expected to taste more of the chestnut, but it paired well with the beets.For the main course, we had the baked cod with the pumpkin puree, potatoes and some vegetables on the side. The pumpkin puree was extremely tasty with the potatoes and the fish. This was definitely my favourite out of all the other starters I had tried.The restaurant is located in a nice and quiet area, great for strolling around and taking in the crisp air."

Guests are mainly tourists, it doesn't seem that the locals are dining there which tells you a lot. Still worth a visit just be prepared that you'll pay more than it is worth.

Our server, Daniel, was great. We had plenty of opportunities to talk with the chef during many of the courses. He was charming and anxious to share his knowledge.Sitting at the chef's table has many perks including a tour of the restaurant between courses. This included a tour of the nursery where many of the greens we enjoyed are grown.Overall this is a top of the charts experience. What a great treat"

321396085,50,"October 24, 2015","Unique setting, amazing restaurant with a difference!","Me and my boyfriend (27) visited the restaurant for a special occasion after finding it on tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. It was very easy to find after getting a tram from the centre of Amsterdam and took around 20 minutes. The location is excellent, set aside from the road but visible enough to make an impression. We walked across the bridge and found the entrance. We were greeted by a lovely lady who took our coats and showed us to our seats. WOW what an impressive room- sat in a glass greenhouse, immaculate tables and beautiful decoration. We were given the wine list and chose the 3 course meal surprise option priced at 49 euros per person. We took in the amazing surroundings whilst drinking wine and waited for our first course. This was soup- beautifully flavored with celery grown in the greenhouse next door served in a glass! The taste was amazing. We had another course that followed consisting of a vegetable mix, and beef served with mushrooms, beetroot and more veg. For the main we had white perch, potato rosti, pumpkin jus and pine nuts- AMAZING! We were then offered the cheese board- this was the only downfall as it was not offered in the 49 euros- but sounded like it was. This was 11 euros per person and we didn't enjoy it. Following this we had a white chocolate sponge dessert served with barbecued pear sorbet- this was beautifully finished with words of celebration 'congratulations' and 'happy birthday' on my boyfriends plate. Each course was explained well before we ate which added a special touch. Another nice thing was that you never felt rushed, time was given inbetween each meal. After we had finished, we were able to look around the greenhouses where all the local vegetables are produced and grown and offered an apple each on the way out! Overall, excellent service, a setting that is unique and one we will never forget! Perfect for our special occassion! Would recommend to anyone who is visiting Amsterdam and looking for a beautiful meal!! Thankyou!!!! :)"

I'm gluten free and was able to have bread and cake during the meal which was nice as I can sometimes miss out on these little treats! All in all a lovely lunch in a beautiful setting."

Even though it is one big space the entourage was cosy and enjoyable. Dishes were define and delicious. Only the staff was too stiff and impersonal. Nowadays staff can throughly be more caring and interested in my opinion. That's what set the 5 stars from the 4.

The restaurant is on the edge of a park in a converted greenhouse -- on one side of the greenhouse and out doors are some of their gardens which supply the meal. The meal is set -- 3 small starters (we had a potato soup with fennel, pumpkin slice with pumpkin hummus, and mushrooms on puff pastry), a main course (veal done 2 ways), and dessert (beetroot with pistachios and chocolate bits, yogurt, and sea salt caramel ice cream), and an optional cheese course. It was all delicious with a depth of flavor, beautifully present, and an unusual combination of ingredients -- when did you last have beetroot in a dessert? Also the tables are just far enough apart that you don't think you are eating with your neighbor, and the noise level is controlled. We went back looking forward to the meal and were not disappointed. We will go back again!"
318202408,50,"October 13, 2015",Our must go place in Amsterdam!,"We've dined at Restaurant De Kas a number of time, and always found the experience exceptional. Our most recent visit, on the last night of a lengthy Eurpean vacation, was just that. The farm to table approach ensures all the food served is fresh and healthy, and it was prepared and served with great care. The menu is fixed, except they usually offer a alternative to meat for the main course. The wine pairings a done nicely and reasonably priced. De Kas is different from all the other restaurants in Amsterdam, and the experience is worth the cost. Great ambience and fun night."
317985277,50,"October 12, 2015",Perfect lunch in the park!,Wrote a review in May but for some reason it did not post so will try again. Unique restaurant set in the middle of a beautiful park. There are windows everywhere form the walls to the ceilings which made you feel like you were sitting right in the park. There is also a greenhouse connected where most of the food is grown. We decided to try the tasting menu and we were not disappointed. Everything was super fresh and flavored perfectly. Wine selection was also good. Great dining experience with great food.
316199566,50,"October 4, 2015",Extremely Satisfying Dining Experience,"The restaurant is set in a quiet park away from the center of Amsterdam. It consists of a few giant greenhouses. The restaurant is set in one of these and the others are used for growing the vegetables and fruits served at dinner. Most of the other ingredients are locally sourced.There is only one menu each evening consisting of 3-4 appetizers, an entree, and dessert. A wine pairing, which I highly would recommend, is also offered at an additional cost. The food was prepared and presented in such a way that the flavors were crisp and distinct without attempting to be too hip for the sake of trendiness. Each dish and paired wine was offered by a different wait staff member who described it in a concise yet informative presentation. De Kas ensures that the fresh ingredients, perfectly prepared, are the stars of the dinner. The paired wines were perfect accompaniments to each course.The high roof of the greenhouse helps maintain a very low noise level allowing for an intimate setting. Definitely make reservations in advance and prepare yourself for a memorable dining experience."
316129114,50,"October 4, 2015",Loved it,"You have to put your diet in the hands of the Restaurent set menu but every course was wonderful. Service was great, setting really nice - recommended"
316041332,50,"October 4, 2015",A gorgeous meal in the park!,"Had booked for a birthday lunch with a friend. The setting amidst the greenhouse growing the restaurant's fruits, vegetables and herbs was an amazing experience. The lunch menu was beautifully prepared and flavored. The Dutch wines surprisingly paired with the courses. A lovely place to enjoy good food, take in the serenity of the surroundings and indulge!"
315411963,50,"October 1, 2015",Exceptional food quality and taste in very nice atmosphere,This is an amazing restaurant. The place raises its own friut and vegetable. The taste is exceptional. Each evening there is just one menue for everybody with vegetable of the season and from own production. It is one of the best reataurants I had the pleasure to experience.As the quality is known at locals it is highly recommended to make a reservation in advance. this place is fully booked eache evening.
315401061,50,"October 1, 2015",Amsterdam's very Best!,"the experience from beginning to end was fantastic. As a foodie, each morsel was relished, and each course better than the next. The only thing better than this was the reception from the entire team. Our server for lunch was Daiga, who did a tremendous job of looking after our every need. This was well worth every Euro spent on the lunch and frankly is a must stop place for either lunch or dinner, but be cautioned, book ahead to avoid disappointment!"
315023151,40,"September 30, 2015",Excellent meal in unusual setting,"We had an excellent meal here. The restaurant is set in a park in the south of Amsterdam - about 6 tram stops from the centre. It is in a rebuilt greenhouse and uses a lot of fruit and vegetables grown there. But ... it's not a vegetarian restaurant.No a la carte menu: there are 3 courses (or 4 if you want cheese) and you have no idea what is coming, though you are asked if there is anything you cannot eat. We had some delightful courses and we also had their 'wine flight' (E27.50) of 4 different wines to accompany the food. we thought it was all terrific value.So, why only 4 stars? It is because it took an absolute age to get the first course (30 mins after ordering). After that, no problem, but we very nearly left because we were fed up with waiting!Do try this restaurant - which is also very popular with locals; it was absolutely full on a wet Thursday in September."
314668514,50,"September 29, 2015",Beautiful food and location,"A beautiful and exceptionally well run restaurant. The park location is gorgeous and if you have time to kill (as we did) you can explore the veg patch and greenhouses and see where your food is coming from. The waitresses were all lovely and clearly very proud of the food. Everything was explained carefully and helpful recommendations made. The food was outstanding, as was the Dutch sparkling wine!"
314511732,50,"September 28, 2015",Wonderful Farm-to-table experience,"This beautiful restaurant, located in the middle of a quiet city park, was a fantastic experience. The freshest of food, most of it grown in the restaurant's own gardens, is simply delicious. Although the menu is limited, Des Kas's creative use of varied ingredients together with its fun atmosphere, create a wonderful ambience. It was a truly amazing dining experience."
314432045,50,"September 28, 2015",Something diferent,"This restaurant is something different, it is situated in the middle of the park, is surrounded by all green, from inside you can see all around, because all is made by glass even de sealing, the food is amazing, the ingredients all fresh"
314405951,50,"September 28, 2015",Chef's table is amazing,"The four of us booked at De Kas to celebrate a couple of birthdays during our weekend in Amsterdam. We liked the sustainable angle, and the freshness advertised online. The Chef's table gave us front row seats to the rythmn of the kitchen: serene and inventive.The personal implication of each chef presenting ""their"" contribution was delightful, each dish very generous and creative, and each chef unique. Each of us had a favorite (chef/dish)! The enthusiasm of the team was obvious, the owner is doing something very right. The creative combinations to be found in our plate wwere exciting, and most often a success.We finished the evening in the large dining room, magical at night. The pear sauce matched with the Dutch cheeses was amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant!"
313908914,50,"September 26, 2015",Absolutely Beautiful,"We stayed in the Jordaan district of Amsterdam, and walked from our houseboat to De Kas for lunch. It was a pretty aggressive walk, but very doable. It was definitely a great way to see the city. This stunning greenhouse restaurant is located in the Frankendael Park, which feels like you're in the dutch countryside. Their mantra is food tastes best when it's fresh. And, it's fresh alright! All the herbs and greens that touch your plate are grown on site in their greenhouse and neighboring gardens. It would be hard to recommend a dish as the menu changes daily to take advantage of the seasonal spread. Service, ambiance, and food was spectacular. A bit pricy, but worth the experience."
313631245,50,"September 25, 2015",Fresh and Delicious,"Every single dish was melt in your mouth delicious, even the picky eaters at my table thought so. Beautiful presentations, excellent staff, a must if you are visiting Amsterdam"
313480728,50,"September 25, 2015",Absolutely superb !,"Really enjoyed my visit to de Kas this week. As plenty of other reviewers have mentioned, this restaurant is situated in a glasshouse, surrounded by gardens in one of Amsterdam’s parks. I was attending a business dinner with over 100 colleagues, so we had the restaurant to ourselves. The whole environment is very light and “airy”, so even with this number of people, the tables were not cramped with plenty of room to spread out.Our dinner commenced with a glass of pumpkin soup of roasted red kuri squash and braised cavolo nero – absolutely superb. This was followed by a little gem lettuce which had been “flashed” on a hot plate and served with goat’s cheese, anchovies and minced pork. The fish course was good sized portion of smoked salmon with some lovage, a fennel seed brioche and served with a yoghurt dressing. Main course was roasted guinea fowl, served with some mashed potato, kohlrabi and a spiced jus. To end the meal, we were served a slice of chocolate pecan tart, with raspberries, pistachio nuts and some vanilla ice cream. The accompanying Dutch wines had been chosen by the restaurant to compliment each course, starting with a sparkling Riesling and ending with some form of genever liquer - all again were excellent, particularily the reislingAs a menu for 100+ people, I could not fault the choice of dishes or the quality of any the food. All of the vegetables are grown “on site” or on the restaurant’s nearby farm and they really pride themselves on serving the best and freshest ingredients available.As this was a company function, I don’t know the cost of the menu, but for “normal dining”, the three-course dinner menu is priced at €49.50, which consists of three small starters (€18.50) followed by a main course (€21.50) and a dessert at €9.50This was a really great dining experience and I will most definitely be back – just a pity it’s a bit of a journey from my home in Rijswijk."

312345768,50,"September 21, 2015",Exceptional experience!,We booked De Kas a couple of weeks before our trip via their easy online reservation system. We were so glad that we did. This was the best meal we had in our trip through Belgium and the Netherlands. The menu is fixed and the they use products from the garden to make amazing dishes. We especially liked the potato soup with a smoky bacon flavor. The rabbit was also very good. The dessert was the best part to an already exquisite meal. It had so many different flavors that blended together perfectly. This restaurant is an experience. A unique destination of culinary science. The atmosphere is clean and simple. Noise level at capacity was surprisingly muffled. The pacing of dinner was perfect and we never felt rushed. Wait staff checked on us frequently and refilled water without asking. We would certainly dine here again in the future.
312110957,20,"September 20, 2015",Very disappointing choice of restaurant,"This restaurant is poor. On 1st impressions it looks great and the 1st course of soup was excellent. After that the food went downhill massively as did the ambience in the restaurant as it started to thin out. Very pricey for what it is, much better local restaurants in the heart of Amsterdam. Stick to more authentic places to eat and not one that's trying to be something unique... A waste of time."
312056768,50,"September 20, 2015","A ""must do"" restaurant experience","Yes yes yes!!Beautiful location in a greenhouse with an adjoining kitchen garden. Most of the items prepared for dinner were from the gardens and it was elegantly and deliciously prepared.The vibe was comfortable yet the food was fantastic. If you are a picky eater, realize that it is a fixed menu and you'll eat what they bring you (my wife if lactose & gluten free, which they accommodated exceptionally well).The wine pairing was one of the best I have experienced, and I love doing wine pairings when offered! The sommelier clearly made some excellent choices and we enjoyed wines from around Europe. ""Hats off"" to the sommelier, Fabieene I believe her name was.Next time we return to Amsterdam we will return to this restaurant, for sure!"

The horsd'oeuvres included marinated rainbow beetroot chunks; again most probably from the veggie patch. Then seated in the spacious Garden Room, we were briefly overwhelmed that we might need to choose between the three listed starters. But then relieved and delighted that instead they featured sequentially. There was an emphasis on a cornucopia of fresh vegetables in interesting combinations alongside Norwegian salmon (OK not from the nearby lake!), then later guinea fowl. All in combinations that presented flvours so well.The waitresses were so refreshingly helpful and knowledgeable about wine (including Dutch white wines) and one person's request to see the huge Green Egg cooking device mentioned on the menu - he was promptly given a tour of the kitchen to see that impressive sight.Would thoroughly recommend this restaurant serving refreshingly fresh cuisine in a beautiful setting."

Service was very friendly. The menu is not too exhaustive which we like and so we ordered starters and main. I chose pulpo and duck as well as the small accompanying wine package for €15 - which I think is a fair price. The dishes came beautifully arranged and were very well done.The very nice waiter then gave us a tour through the rest of the location, we took a closer look at the kitchen, the room for private function and the greenhouse they are using to bring up the stuff they serve us- obviously they use other locations to grow veggies etc. as the space there is limited.We loved the concept and the overall experience, it is a beautiful and remarkable place!"

310400000,40,"September 15, 2015",Unique atmosphere and vegetables - food experience just ok,"The restautant is located in a garden and you eat in a green house. The ambience and setting is beautiful and truly memorable. The idea with the food to be primarily vegetables and the proteins being secondary is timely and a great idea. Unfortunately both the wine selections as well as the dishes are lacking the necessary ""pop"" to make it a memorable experience."

309411038,40,"September 11, 2015",Nice food and wine but not exceptional,De Kas is situated in a rather large greenhouse and they grow most of the food they serve. I love the concept and the execution was almost perfect.The interior is minimally decorated which I like. The food was very good but the portions were small and it was quite pricey for a lunch time meal.The service was excellent and is probably the best thing about De Kas. The place had quite a formal feel so don't go expecting a buzzing atmosphere.Overall I enjoyed my experience and I probably would go again but it wouldn't be a place I would visit every week if I lived in Amsterdam
308581187,40,"September 9, 2015","Gorgeous place, food not memorable","If you are looking for a beautiful place for your meal, De Kas, a former greenhouse located in a park, is your place. It's really idyllic!Food, however, is not memorable. And, to be honest, the menu looked a little pretentious to me. I had a 2 course lunch meal. Food looked beautiful, but tasted ok. I didn't even bother to have desert.Anyway, I think it was worth it, specially because after lunch I had a long walk in the lovely park."

308125501,50,"September 8, 2015",Greenhouse Dining in Amsterdam,"While in Amsterdam, we had a delicious dinner at the beautiful De Kas restaurant in a greenhouse setting in a park. They have their own garden and use the freshest local ingredients. We chose this establishment on the recommendation of our concierge and were very pleased with the entire experience. We did not realize that the menu which varies weekly consists of a ""surprise"" prix-fixe four course dinner and included vegetarian, fish and meat dishes. The setting is lovely and the service excellent. We are rather picky about our food choices, tending to eat ""healthy"" and everything was prepared perfectly to our specifications. There were many tourists there, far more than locals I would say, and it is a fairly expensive restaurant compared with some others but worth it. We wanted atmosphere as well as great food and we were extremely satisfied. Would definitely return for another surprise meal when back in Amsterdam."
307420870,50,"September 6, 2015","Great venue, great food, great service","I have been to De Kas for dinner with friends and family and yesterday for a wedding.On both occasions they exceeded expectations. It's already worth going there just for the location: a greenhouse, in which they grow their own food. Anything you order is a delicious, out-of-the-ordinary combination of high quality ingredients.Service is friendly and professional.I simply have nothing bad to say about De Kas. Just go there."
307150754,50,"September 5, 2015",You eat what they produce,I went solo after a meeting. It is a very unique experience as there is no menu and you mostly eat what they produce at their backyard.

Waiter explained the wine pairings and the food. Menu was a surprise, as they change the menu every day, but we loved all of it and it meant we had food we wouldn't normally have ordered.

306546182,50,"September 2, 2015",Lived up to it's excellent reputation,"We had been looking forward to this restaurant, as friends had raved about it in advance. It certainly lived up to our expectations. The gorgeous glass conservatory ambiance, attractive and attentive staff, and intriguing, unique menu were each extraordinary. We opted to be surprised for our four course meal, enhanced by the wine flight. While it's not inexpensive, we thought it a great value, as a similar meal in the United States could run well over our tab (we spent about 80 Euros per person, including cocktails and wine). We will pay it forward by recommending this restaurant to anyone who is visiting Amsterdam."

This restaurant is simply about good fresh food. Much of it grown on site. The staff are knowledgeable and interested in what you thought of each course. I am vegetarian and loved it. My husband who is a meat eater felt the same way. He had pigeon for his main, salmon for his starter. We would definitely return."

The simple concept of a menu based in what's available and seasonal in their kitchen gardens means a great experience every time, in a unique setting. The tram will get you close and then after a short walk your experience begins at the door of the glasshouse. Simple furnishings, a cast concrete bar and an always buzzing atmosphere characterise this restaurant. The service is excellent and unobtrusive and the food is fresh, flavoursome, delightful to the eye and simply wonderful on the taste buds. De Kas is a lesson in following a great idea through to every detail and making every dining experience very special."

You have to reserve for 7pm...8-9 courses takes an entire evening. Clearly, my 5'2"" body could not make the hop up to the Viking sized bench/table in the kitchen. After some chuckling, and my request for a milk crate, they brought me a stool so I could hop up. After introductions from the host and chef Niels the courses and pairings began. De Kas has a set menu for the week using what was abundant in their farm, sourcing proteins from local farmers. Watching this professional staff in this pristine kitchen was like watching an opera and ballet at the same time. Tickets come in, courses are called, and plates are created. For us, each time we were served a course, the chef that created it would introduce himself and then explain the course. I loved that the chef was given the ingredient and then allowed to create the course himself. The courses were brilliant containing a wide variety vegetables, sauces, cheeses, protiens. The pairings were inspired and reflected thought and a knowledge of both the food and the grapes. When we were down to the dessert course (that featured cherries, cherries and more cherries) were first given a complete tour of the house and green house. We enjoyed dessert in the main dining room as the staff began kitchen clean up. Chef Bas, Chef Neils, 'the little boy', Lucky Charms, and our lovely host who's name I found impossible to pronounce, thank you so much for one of the best evenings of my life. As a chef, I found DeKas truly inspirational."
299971086,50,"August 16, 2015",Unique Experience,The meal was delicious. The restaurant is inside a nursery and there are front and back gardens. They grow produce there. The chef even showed us around his green house. It is a fixed menu so be prepared. The cooking is very fresh and inventive. Each course is a work of art. We especially liked the strawberry cheesecake. We enjoyed his selection of wine. The price is very reasonable. It is a unique restaurant.

Also be forewarned that it is a fixed menu that changes every day, so for those people without a spirit of adventure, may not be good choice. Service was outstanding, very attentive and helpful. They prepared a great alternate menu for our three-year-old daughter, who loved the food. And the setting is so serene and trendy.

298993693,40,"August 13, 2015",Nice Restaurant with a Green House Flair,"We had friends recommend this restaurant before we left on our trip to Europe. Interesting to be eating in what was apparently once a working greenhouse. Neither of us was prepared for a fixed menu, however, and I would have preferred to have some choice of entrees. That said, the food was well-prepared and ""inventive"". Service was OK, but was a bit slow -surprising in view of the fact we were there on a rainy day and the place was not all that busy. If you like fresh, home-grown vegetables and don't mind having to eat what has been selected for the day I do suggest you give it a try. When we next visit Amsterdam a return visit will be in order - but with a much different set of expectations. PS - the wine selection was quite nice."
298716303,40,"August 13, 2015",Definitely worth a visit while in Amsterdam,"I booked this on a whim on our last day in Amsterdam, me and my partner were very pleased with my choice. Ingredients and food were very fresh, location in a glasshouse made for great atmosphere on a summer afternoon. Easily accessible from central Amsterdam by tram only a three minute walk away. Was very memorable and will definitely visit while next in Amsterdam."
298684237,50,"August 13, 2015",Best dining in Amsterdam!,"From the moment we stepped onto the property we felt the magic of this place! The setting is so charming, the wait staff so welcoming, and the food is sublime! It is a set menu based on what is grown in their gardens that day so the suprises keep coming. Do yourself a favor and let them pair your wines! Don't miss this jem!"
297678360,50,"August 10, 2015",One of the most memorable meals of my life,"Two well traveled friends each recommended this spot and we are so glad. Made an on line reservation in advance but was already limited to the one night they still had available during our trip. So book ahead. The restaurant is inside a nursery, all glass and beautifully designed. In frontt and back are gardens where they grow produce and flowers in addition to a larger off site farm. The menu is unpublished and changes each week...my husband is vegan and all accommodations were made. Each of three courses was exceptionally delicious and so beautifully displayed. Truly works of art. You can taste the fresh vegetables and flowers....every aspect is considered. Highly recommend and try to go during day light if possible for full effect. We are from NYC so the price was profoundly reasonable for this level of quality and experience."
297003532,50,"August 8, 2015",One of the best meals of my life.,"We reserved the chef's table for one evening during our trip to Amsterdam. I can honestly say it was one of the best meals of my life. We were seated at a lovely table in the kitchen and could see the chefs as they worked. The chefs were gracious and welcoming; each one introduced the dish they had personally prepared and told us about the ingredients and their local sources. The sommelier was friendly and knowledgeable (and generous with the pours for the wine accompaniments!). We had a post dinner tour of the restaurant's greenhouses and gardens (where most of the fruit and vegetable ingredients come from) before returning for dessert.We were probably there for about 4 hours altogether, never rushed as we enjoyed our long multi course meal. The food was fresh, beautifully prepared, and delicious. The surroundings are gorgeous--it's really something to be dining in large converted glass greenhouses in the middle of a beautiful park!I still can't believe what a good price we paid for a truly premium meal and experience. We were so impressed with the obvious pride everyone had in their restaurant. We would definitely go back."
296960393,40,"August 8, 2015",Worth the visit,"A very unique restaurant located in the middle of a park. The structure is a glasshouse where they grow and serve their vegetables. The service is top-notch as well as the ambiance. Set menu which understandingly revolves around greens. Very good courses but not memorable. Worth the visit and the price for the surroundings, staff, and uniqueness. Don't miss the stork's nest across from the entrance."
296832477,50,"August 8, 2015",Surprise food in an amazing location!,Beautiful place and great concept! The menu changes according to what the restaurant has grown so you don't know what you're going to get. It was nice to be surprise and all dishes were amazing. Lots of new tastes and excellent quality!
295253843,50,"August 3, 2015",Fabulous food and setting,We had lunch here on a hot day and it was amazing. The menu was a set menu centred on fish which one of our party can't eat. They added some vegetarian dishes to our meal with ease and they were some of the stars of the show. This is a fabulous place to experience the freshest home grown vegetables cooked with Michelin finesse to produce dishes that demand oohs and aahs. We were on the terrace but the interiors looked super stylish - will definitely return for dinner.
294965678,40,"August 2, 2015",very good food and relaxing ambience,"My husband and I had dinner there with a friend. It was really good. The service was impeccable. The food was very fresh, mostly seafood and veggies (from their garden). The wine pairing was also very good. We were surprised to find the sparkling white wine from The Netherlands really good and also the Austrian red wine.You have to book a week in advance, though as the place is quite famous."
293900141,50,"July 29, 2015",Greenhouse dining,"We cycled to this very elegant greenhouse restaurant outside the city center of Amsterdam. It was the one time I felt overtly under-dressed in Amsterdam. Smart casual might be the best way to describe the environment. The restaurant is in an underwhelming park, but its decor and food is well worth the trip out of town. The dining space is light, airy and modern. It is simple and bright. The wait staff is friendly. The food ample and innovative. I imagine it is even prettier by night than by day, but it was a very pleasant place to lunch, and when compared to Manhattan prices also a good value. I would not bring children here unless they are quiet, well mannered, and have a reasonably sophisticated palette. It isn't the right environment for a weed smoking, hemp hugging teenager in a deadhead t-shirt either. The staff is polite and casually friendly, but I think they take the food and the service seriously without being ostentatious about it. Diners are invited to explore the greenhouse, but must be mindful not to let the bees out - or in - I forget. We enjoyed two glasses of wine, but had been given enough food that cycling back to the city center was not a problem."
293411769,40,"July 28, 2015",Good dining experience !,"The restaurant is located right inside a park in Amsterdam, great atmosphere all around. The design is excellent, I loved the 'greenhouse' style and the glass roof/walls. The service was excellent, we were very impressed by a young man with blonde hair who took care of our wine order, he was very friendly and recommended different areas that we could visit. The food was 8/10, it was definitely tasty and fresh but the portions were quite small for their price. It is definitely recommended for a visit."
293340064,50,"July 28, 2015",Best place for farm-to-table fresh ingredient lunch with gourmet flare,"My husband and I are foodies, and we have to say one of the best meals we've had in Amsterdam! Enjoyed lunch on their beautiful patio overlooking the gardens. All fresh ingredients with gorgeous plating. Excellent wine as well. The only downside was my husband was craving a beer on a warm summer day, and they don't serve beer."
292352421,50,"July 25, 2015",Beautiful Setting and Meal at De Kas in Amsterdam,We enjoyed our experience at De Kas. The restaurant is outside the center of Amsterdam so it was a 10-15 minute taxi ride each way. The open dining room with light shining through the late evening (at 8:30 pm) created a really nice atmosphere and surroundings. The menu is fixed price and you are surprised with each course from beginning to end. We enjoyed each course and they were very accommodating with our gluten free diet restrictions as we also let them know in advance. The wine was our only extra cost. The service was very good as well as they described each course as they were served. We really liked the farm to table concept as well as the location being outside the tourist areas. You have an opportunity to walk the greenhouse so you may want leave some time to do that as well. The restaurant will call for a taxi for you and it will arrive within 5 minutes.
291368086,30,"July 22, 2015",Great atmosphere. Average food.,Very nice vegetables and ingredients. Quite simple. The combinations were not always that good though. We were 3 people.
291305941,50,"July 21, 2015",Beautiful setting and food,"Business trip of around 20 people and we were seated together in a large room next to the greenhouse ,we could see lots of ingredients being grown for the kitchen.The food was described as it came out as lots of ingredients were unknown or untried like flowers and cucumber ice cream.It was a good experience and the food was very good please visit this lovely park and enjoy the food."
290365815,50,"July 19, 2015",Sunday Lunch,De Kas was unusually open on the Sunday of our weekend trip to Amsterdam as it was mothers day there. Lucky for us as it was a very interesting and enjoyable meal. Lovely to walk around the garden and greenhouse to view the home grown produce and to discuss their philosophy with the staff. Had a lovely local sparkling wine as an aperitif.
290090852,30,"July 18, 2015","Overpriced, lost authenticity, highly tourist oriented","Been there several years ago a couple of times.The best that changed were the storks, that are now situated on a different chimney and can be viewed from the terrace.For a three course menu (the first course is split in three), aperitif (10euro's) wine arrangement, water, coffee, about 190 Euro's for two iis expensive. Especially when considering that all guests eat the same. This means very easy cooking and economy in acquiring ingredients.So one expects really something special. Although the food is OK it is not special, except the fact that all most ingredients come from the Beemster.We felt the compositions were also to complex in terms of taste, which made it a bit artificial. Also the personnel behaved friendly but also a bit artificial, at all tables exactly the same explanations were given, well rehearsed.So the place is not bad, but not authentic anymore (except the storks), they have unfortunately become an apparently highly appreciated tourist attraction, given the fact the are booked almost any night."
289528344,50,"July 16, 2015",Special meal in a special environment,"De Kas was recommended by friends, and it appeared on several lists of special restaurants in Amsterdam. We were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived and had cocktails on the patio to the final touches, everything was thoughtful, delicious, and well presented. The location should not be a deterrent. It was totally worth the trip to dine here. Go!"
289126387,30,"July 15, 2015",Not a good experience,"We heard so much about it. Unfortunately not a good night. Service was sloppy, food was just ok but lacking seasoning. Defenetely not what we expected. Unfortunately not a good night. Over priced. Sorry"
288961898,50,"July 14, 2015",Relaxing Treat,"We arrived at 7 and never left until after 10. The service was excellent, and we were made to feel as if we were the only ones being served; it was a very personable staff. The wine pairings were delicious. Amsterdam's own Bessen Jenever red dessert wine, paired with the beet chocolate cake and mint yogurt ice cream was perfect on a hot night. Being surprised by each course added to the fun. I can't say enough about this unique dining experience."
288862982,30,"July 14, 2015",Pretentious and expensive for what it is trying to be,"We had read about this restaurant at home in Italy and were very keen to try it for lunch yesterday, when we had finally found it! You can't see it from the road, as it is in a park over a little bridge. The buildlings, gardens and decor of the restaurant do not dissappoint, inside it is very stylish and bright with an open kitchen that you can look into, a beautiful bar area and excellent service. The very friendly waitress explained that there is no 'a la carte' and you cannot choose (very easy for the 'chef'!), the lunch menu costs €39 pp for two courses which seemed quite expensive to me. The starters (split in three?) consisted of a small cup of cold cucumber soup, a peace of toast with vegetables & goats cheese and a very small salad with grilled courgettes and ONE (??!)small mediteranian prawn or gamba plus a square piece of watermelon that seemed really out of place, like a fish out of water.... Then the fish, a pan fried skate, thin strips of tasteless white strings, neither of us wanted to eat it so we left it, but luckily the polenta and beans on the side were very tasty and the Italian white wine we had ordered was crisp. I did ask why they would serve skate as it is not a usual 'Dutch' fish, and being a scuba diver, I prefer to see all types of rays swim in the see not fried on my plate! They offered us the coffee on the house.... They were very nice but for a place that is trying to promote all their own home grown produce, they should try stay closer to home with their fish/meat choices and although all the dishes where presented very nicely, I still think for what they were & how they tasted, they lacked quality and were overpriced..... To top it all off we came back tot our car (parked along the road over the bridge, in a paid car parking area!) the rear window had been smashed in and a nice jacket (the only thing left in the car with any value....) had been stolen... So if we the €270 we have to pay for a new window to the €134 we spent at De Kas, it was a very expensive lunch indeed and one not to be repeated! So please, if you do visit 'De Kas' DON'T park along the Kamerlingh Onneslaan, but find a covered carpark instead!"
287538808,50,"July 10, 2015",wonderful birthday in de kas,"i was there with my husband and daughter in June 2015 for my birthday, we had lunch in a very cold day for June, the place amazing, food wobderful, people polite and friendly, price right. Don't miss the place."
287349162,50,"July 9, 2015",Wonderful Dining Experience!,"My husband and I went for lunch and it was such a great dining experience. Lovely service, atmosphere, design, and the food was incredible. The freshness and organic produce used in each dish, the presentation and the flavours were so good! You definitely need to make reservations as they fill up quickly, it is a set menu each day using their locally grown produce and fresh ingredients. My husband and I had this restaurant on our list for a while and we're so glad we were able to finally go, can't wait to return!"
286625810,50,"July 7, 2015",Second visit - just as excellent,this time we went to De Kas for lunch. Excellent food and service yet again. Fresh healthy food in a great building

285662433,40,"July 4, 2015",A wonderful Restaurant,"Nice pleasant restaurant, good food good service. We had dinner which is limited to a five course one menu cooked based on the days harvest. We had a selection between fish and duck, quite a busy restaurant so best is to get a reservation before you go."
284984781,50,"July 2, 2015",Our second visit was just as good as the first,"This is a wonderful place to spend an evening. The food is all grown in the surrounding greenhouses or else its locally sourced. The offerings are inventive and presented beautifully. In this restaurant you will be served what is on the menu for the day, you won't be able to pick your entree. However, they do have vegetarian options and will adapt their menu to any food allergies or dislikes. This is not a place for a meat and potatoes person. They will be disappointed. They will however, renew your love of fresh produce!"
284761379,50,"July 1, 2015",Worth the trip out of the main city,"We splashed out for the kitchen table and compared to some UK michelin star restaurants for their tasting menu the price is reasonable. From memory we paid around 120 euros each including the wine tasting.The restaurant booking online was simple and easy even though we don't speak dutch. The welcome was fantastic and the meal was very memorable. Sitting in the Greenhouse next to plants that have been picked to provide your dinner is a must for any food lover or gardener.We had a very enjoyable time here, with a superb information from the sommelier and the chefs. We were made to feel very welcome and each dish was presented beautifully and the flavours were fresh and everything was perfectly cooked. Highly recommend going in a season that suits the food you like."
284740085,50,"July 1, 2015",Class of 2015,"What a place to celebrate a big day! We were six people having a superb evening with 5 curse dinner, with short-traveled food, wine packet and very friendly staff. Topp food, wonderful location - and for a reasonable price. We'll be back."
284652979,50,"July 1, 2015",Foodies,"Highly recommend this restaurant. Best for people who love fresh veggies. My husband the steak and potato eater was not as pleased with it. The location is the ""Brooklyn"" of Amsterdam. Not a place to shop or go out, but a place where families move for me green space, but are still close to the city. The restaurant is in a green house where they grow the produce. Pretty cool. The peas are incredible."
284036589,50,"June 29, 2015",Beautiful and unique!,My husband and I dined at De Kas in July 2014. We biked from our hotel to the beautiful greenhouse right outside the city center. The ambience of the restaurant simply cannot be beat. Just gorgeous and full of natural light. The food was just as lovely -- beautifully prepared and locally sourced. A wonderful dinner in a wonderful setting.
283364792,50,"June 27, 2015",Organic yumminess in lovely setting,"Their card says: ""Harvest from the Tunnel Greenhouse"" and that about sums it up. You are dining IN a greenhouse. As you enter you will see gorgeous plants heavy with the bounty you are about to indulge in. I saw that there were peas on the vine and then there later appeared a cup of soup in front of me made of peas and other things from their produce. And it was delicious. We have eaten here on previous trips and it is a destination for us. The setting is GORGEOUS...it was raining when we were there and it just added to the ambience as the drops hit the glass. One of our party was a vegetarian and they accommodated her beautifully while we enjoyed roast chicken. My husband had eaten here the night before with biz associates and he said the offerings were equally delicious and completely different! The only issue I had was that we came with our 12 year old and they (like most high end restaurants) tend to want to seat people with kids at a crappy table. But my husband pointed out that he had made a reservation WAY in advance and had dined there the night before and requested a table in a certain area and the hostess, although not super sweet about it, did accommodate us. I won't let that drop my review to 4 stars but come on people. Stop trying to marginalize people with kids."
283259767,50,"June 26, 2015",Nice dinner in a light and airy greenhouse,One of our better meals in Amsterdam. The location is lovely. A working greenhouse in a park about 10 minutes from where we were staying - Vodelspark. Food was simply and nicely cooked making use of fresh ingredients some sourced from their greenhouse but mainly working with local suppliers. Had dinner with their wine pairings which was enthusiastically served. Only a set menu though so those with allergies or preferences should call the restaurant first. Nice !
282975473,50,"June 25, 2015",Garden delight,"Taking a friend known for being a fussy eater, the evening could have turned in to a disaster as I did not know when booking that De Kas served a set menu. I can eat anything so was rather pleased when every dish my friend was presented with was relished and I let out a joyful 'phew' each time we were were presented with 3 starters, 1 main course, followed by a dessertThe spanish olive oil and soda bread tasted of green grass and set the tone of quality to comeThe flavours of the delicate vegetables accompanying each dish - from long cooked veal cheak to barbequed chicken was a real delightDrinking a lovely Dutch sparking while the evening sun shone through the greenhouse setting, this topped off a lovely trip combining gourmet food with 17th century canal house and Rijkmuseum artA glamorous place with equally well groomed diners, the whole restaurant appeared to share in the collective satisfacion of excellent food and despite the gasp at the lack of choice my friend was as happy as I was and we would recommend without hesitation"
282946061,50,"June 25, 2015",very good,This restaurant was a nice meeting with excellent food. We really enjoyed the meal. We was on a bussinesstrip to Amsterdam and the company we visited took us here. It was the best restaurant we visited for this time in Amsterdam.

282517723,40,"June 23, 2015",LIVED UP TO ITS REPUTATION,"Two of my children (youngish adults) said we just had to go to De Kas as it is one of the most exciting restaurants they had ever visited, so it was with a great deal of anticipation that my wife and along with three friends went there for lunch in early May. The setting is great and we were blessed with a perfect Spring day to enjoy the building and its surroundings. You take pot luck with the food because it is a set menu of what is the best available on the day and again our luck seemed to be in because virtually everything that arrived was excellent. The service was very good as was the entire experience. I cannot say this is the best restaurant I have ever been to but it is certainly in the top five."
282363085,40,"June 23, 2015",Very nice place,"I was on a short trip in Amsterdam and had only possibility to have lunch here as on that day it was not possible to reserve a table for dinner. Overall my experience was good, the presentation of food, the place it self and the service was nice. The only comment I had about food was very much salt in the fish. Other then this everything was good."
281328015,50,"June 19, 2015",Organic dining in idyllic setting,About 20 mins ride in tram no. 9 from Central station and well worth the travelling time. They grow and supply organic vegetables for the restaurant - all dishes taste superb! The restaurant is set in a glasshouse in the centre of a lake - we were enjoying the dishes while looking at the grass swaying gently outside.

281074721,50,"June 18, 2015",A must visit,"This restaurant is a must-visit in Amsterdam. It's a little way out of the city, but we rented bikes and had a lovely ride out there for our lunch. We did the set menu, and every item served was perfect and unique. The food was 100% fresh and every bite had a really interesting mix of flavors. I loved walking around the outside and seeing the garden where a lot of their food is grown. You can tell a lot of care is put into the preparation. I also appreciated that it didn't feel pretentious, everything was explained to us and the staff was very friendly. It's a little pricey, but the location, design of the restaurant, and quality of the food is totally worth it."
280930194,50,"June 17, 2015",Second visit as good as the first!,This is our second time at this lovely restaurant. A great concept with greenhouses adjoining the restaurant. Everything is fresh and I believe the produce is all organic. Everything is grown there or locally acquired. Service is outstanding. The food is excellent and very unique. It will make you love vegetables if you don't already. But don't worry they serve meat as well. We will go back whenever we visit.

277134822,40,"June 1, 2015","Farm to Table,nice!","De Kas is such a beautiful restaurant, situated slightly off city centre of Amsterdam. However, going to De Kas is still not very difficult with the wide coverage of trams and buses. You can easily visit by taking tram 9 to Hogeweg, De Kas is just in front of you once you alight from the tram.There is no menu. It all depends on what are the harvest from the farm for the week. All you have to do is to decide if you'd like to have two or three course meals or three small dishes or just the main dish. Life is full of surprises! But it's too bad for you if you're a picky eater, you have no control at all, for what you will be served.Do let the waitress recommend you suitable wines to go along with the menu of the day. Trust them fully, and you'll get a perfect match.The food can be a bit bland for some people, but I think it's perfect as you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I've never like beetroot, but I've fallen in love with the beetroot we were served.It can be a little warm if you dine here during the day as it is a glass house. However, the lighting was perfect for photography. Nice food photos during the day.For more details, do visit the entry in my blog:http://photocautious.blogspot.sg/2015/05/from-farm-to-plate-at-de-kas.html"

We had about 7 courses which are all paired with lovely wines. As each course is served the chef that cooked it, they would come over and explain what the dish was and how it was made!! Every dish presented so well ... All so pretty and colourful, who knew all the different things you can make with vegetables!! Then you get a tour of there amazing gardens, where all there produce Is grown! For your final two courses you sit back in the main restaurant, a converted green house!!

They grown their own vegetables around the restaurant and lots more in the local area. You do not eat a la carte, you can choose between menu, starters, main dish which is changed every day. The veggies are prepared in a fine and unexpected way, very delicious and uncommon."
273125645,40,"May 19, 2015",Most unusual meal,Set within a large greenhouse that was originally the Amsterdam Municipal nursery. Most of the meal is prepared from fresh organically grown produce from their own greenhouse or bought in from neighboring farms. It was a set menu with small personalized changes to suit personal dietary requirements. My husband had asked them to arrange a special champagne which they gladly did. The meal was extremely fresh and tasty with special emphasis on the home grown vegetables. Our waiter was superb and a great evening was enjoyed by us all. Definitely worth going to but you should book in advance.
273005465,40,"May 19, 2015",Delicious and pure with an ever changing menu,"My wife and I visited this restaurant recently, while it has been on our list for a couple of years. We just never quite got around to go there. It's conveniently located by both public transport and car and the spot is really beautiful.Immediately when you arrive you get soaked into the pure and local experience that this restaurant is known for. The hostess tells about the vegetables and herbs they produce themselves in their own ""Kas"".We were seated near a place where they have a large table for I guess 14/16 people, which was not used that evening. That place is slightly separated from the rest and also contains a wine bar and a fire place. Quite nice if you ask me.The food then: every week or so the menu changes completely and is always based on a couple of basic principles: as local as possible (if they don't grow it themselves, they use farmers that are close by), inspired by the season and of course as fresh as possible.Although this is quite an expensive and high level restaurant, it doesn't feel like it in general. The staff is friendly and helpful, but you do notice the way the restaurant is positioned reflects on the prices. Don't expect to spend less than € 65-70 per person if you want to enjoy a good wine as well. But it's well worth it.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because our main dish was based on chicken. It was delicious, but looking at the fixed menu price, the week before or after people might have gotten a nice steak or salmon for instance. Which is basically the only complaint: not so much the fact you cannot choose what is being served, but that this isn't reflected in the price at all."
272019052,40,"May 14, 2015",Oh so good and yet...,"As others have mentioned, the place itself is so lovely and we were there while the sun was setting, so the lighting evolved and became another element of the experience. And again as others have stated, there is a standard and set menu. Because of the time of year we were there (April), the preponderance of items were root vegetables (fennel soup, roasted celeriac, the main course of cod came with beets). Although the food was tasty, we would have preferred a less limited menu -- or wished for a different time of year with different choices."
271943407,50,"May 14, 2015",A great dinning experience,"Situated in a Green house off centre of Amsterdam , in a pleasant surrounding you will be served a single 4 courses menu with home grown fresh seasonal ingredients .All the dishes were visually pretty and full of flavours .Book in advance to avoid disappointment ."
271836661,40,"May 13, 2015",Excellent dinner,"Fabulous restaurant with excellent settings. Found this restaurant on the internet and booked it 4 months in advance. I emailed them to say that we are vegetarians and that my husband does not even eat eggs. They remembered when we arrived. That's 4 months after booking. The good thing is they served nice veggie food but would not go there very often. It's nice to try out once.The staff were informative about each course they brought to our table and conversed with us in a good manner. Because I mentioned that we had gone there for our 10th wedding anniversary, they surprised our desert with chocolate writing of 'congratulations' and '10 years'."
271823094,30,"May 13, 2015",What's the big deal?,"We were excited to try this restaurant since it was so highly rated - the setting is very pleasing to the eye and the actual restaurant is very nicely appointed - we went on a Friday evening around 7:45 pm and we didn't leave until 10:30 pm - we ordering the prix fixe menu and yes there are 3 small appertizers but to wait over an hour for our main course is totally unacceptable, the only reason we left at 10:30 was because we had a train out very, very early the next morning so I had to ask for them to expedite dessert - the food was good but I can easily say that we had better food during our stay in Amsterdam - In doing research for this restaurant I never came across the words ' slow food movement' - if that's what they are or want to be that should be identified so people know - if we were to return to Amsterdam any time soon, we would not make a return visit to this restaurant no matter how local the food and also beware of the cost - cost shouldn't be a factor for bad service"
271397051,40,"May 11, 2015",An event by every meal - even gluten free Winther a smile,Exceptional place with dedicated People - both in the kitchen and on the floor! Fixed menus inspired by the season
270434845,40,"May 6, 2015",Nice surprise,"When we arrived, the view was beautiful: a nice glass house with a greenhouse and, stuck to it, a large restaurant with lighting that changes color. When asked for the menu, our attendant answered if we'd like to accept the chef's suggestion : a surprise menu. With a little trepidation, we accepted. And it was the best thing we did: entrances to dessert, everything was great, with new flavors and delicious combinations. Although the quantities served in each dish are small, we left quite satisfied. I will certainly return to the site, but i not indicate to whom only have space on the agenda for the Old Cuisine."
270347761,50,"May 6, 2015",Incredible Lunch,"Fabulous restaurant with incredible food, exceptional service and a beautiful setting.I had this place recommended to me by a friend and as I was in Amsterdam for my birthday with my mum we chose this place for a little birthday lunch celebration.We certainly weren't disappointed. With a daily menu depending on which seasonal ingredients are available and matching wines for each dish everything about this place was perfection.The pièce de résistance was the beautifully presented birthday desert!"
270070752,50,"May 4, 2015",Unique dining experience ....,"A greenhouse located in the center of one of Amsterdams beautiful park,this restaurant breaks all norms...from growing all their vegetables and herbs on site to a single set menu each week to an incredible setting you an not go wrong... Food is exquisite and must be planned for days in advance as the waiting list to dine is extensive...enjoy!!!!!"
269954187,50,"May 4, 2015",Great restaurant!,"Fantastic place. Very exciting eating a menu when you don`t know what you are going to get! Everything tasted good, and had high quality. Friendly and informative staff. Highly recommanded restaurant!"
269676846,40,"May 3, 2015",An organic experience..,"A great spot on a sunny afternoon. Definitely glad we had lunch rather than dinner just in terms of enjoying the greenhouse effect.. Light and airy with delicious fish courses and some pretty good wine. Extremely friendly staff, helpful and efficient but by no means all over you. In fact they were a bit slow with our main course... but it was no chore to wait. It`s a surprise what you eat which appeals to me as i tend to chose unwisely. Possibly slightly expensive but couldn`t fault the experience. We left feeling well fed and energised.. and a little bit poorer. Best olives ever."
269312244,50,"May 1, 2015",What an experience,"This restaurant was on the top of my list to go to and it did not disappoint. I went for lunch (which is only available on weekdays) with my family. You need to book in advance. The menu is set, but they cater for allergies etc. We had our lunch inside and then went outside for our coffee/dessert after, which was suggested by our waitress as it was a beautiful day. Food and drinks are sourced locally as much as possible and staff are able to explain where products are from e.g. own garden or affiliated farm. You can wonder around the gardens in and around the greenhouse. We had a two-year old with us and staff were very friendly towards her and attentive - they brought colouring pens and paper and suggested apple juice, which came in a small bottle with the lid still on, in which they punched a hole for the straw."
268745467,40,"April 28, 2015",Geen house dining,This restaurant is located in a very large green house located within an Amsterdam city park. They grow most of their vegetables and a lot o the fruit. Service is attentive and jovial. Food is quite inventive.
268522426,50,"April 28, 2015",A food experience,"The location inside a greenhouse is pretty amazing in itself, the food matches the expectations and the athmosphere is quite unique. Loved it! They introduced us to some very tasty local wines. The only negative was that I really wanted to have had the chefs table."
267419314,50,"April 22, 2015",Fantastic setting and food,We booked this restaurant a week before we visited with friends from Belgium making it a party of 5. The restaurant is in a green house set in a park and it was freezing the evening we arrived and I was hoping we would be warm - we were and the welcome was warm too. The food is sourced locally - on site as well as in their field further away from the park. The food was very good and generous - we all thought we could not eat the large desert portion but we all did. When we left we took one of their apples so we continued to enjoyed the hospitality the day after. Really good - would definitely return
266934954,50,"April 20, 2015","Wow, amazing meal","We come from cities where local, fresh and organic are the staples in restaurant cooking, De Kas really steps up to the competition! The food was original, fresh, and delicious. We are vegetarians who eat fish when traveling and they completely matched our expectations for a wonderful dinner.Make sure to asks about the architectural changes they made to adapt the simple greenhouse into this environmentally savvy building that helps produce some of the restaurant's food sources. A real unique meal experience."
266577355,50,"April 19, 2015",Fresh food straight from the farm,"We had dinner at De Kas (kas is greenhouse in Dutch). The food was fresh and seasonal. They have a set meal which changes with the products they receive from the farm every day. We has a fish soup that was both tasty and hearty, fresh herbs brought the fresh flavors of the fish out. We also had a lamb dish which included mint. We had some vegetables that were new to us but also enjoyable. The service was great and the noice level was low. The only weakness was the quality of the wine pairings. Go enjoy!"
266413376,50,"April 18, 2015","An experience, not just to fill the stomach","De Kas a year ago was one of the top few restaurants in Amsterdam. I managed to snag a last minute reservation the day before, and thank heavens that materialised. This restaurant grows their own stuff, and if not possible, sources it from ethical farms or companies. I arrived a little early at this glass house in a park just about 10 minutes out of Amsterdam. As it was a beautiful day, we were invited for an aperitif in the garden where they grew their own herbs and vegetables.I was left to spend some quiet time with my other half, and at no time did I felt rushed to finish my drink and the snacks. The waiter came by to check if we had any dietary restrictions. There aren't any menus, and whatever you are gonna eat that day is up to the whim and fancy of the chef, and whats in season. If you do not eat something, this is the time to tell them. Like no cucumber, coriander, onion or whatever, and they would take note and ensure its not inside.For a fixed price, you get 3 hors d'oeuvres, a main course and a dessert. Wine pairing is possible, at an additional cost. To put it simply, it was an experience I would take with me to my grave. The price is not mind blowing, and you would have enough spare change for that tram ride back into the city. Eat here, and make sure you set a side 2-3 hours for it, to experience the place, the food, and the art of making everything just sublime."
266376731,40,"April 18, 2015",Clever concept wonderfully executed,"Great location, in a large greenhouse type building in a park by a river. 15 min cab ride from the centre of Amaterdam. Not for the overly fussy eater as there is only a set menu, but what it lacks in choice it makes up for in freshness (vegetables grown on site) and imagination. Friendly service and nice atmosphere - made up of well to do tourists and the Amsterdam chattering classes. Not cheap but very good. Even had a lovely children's menu for my fussy 11 year old daughter. If they can keep her happy, they must be doing something right!"

265474507,40,"April 13, 2015",Great food! Don't expect speedy service,My boyfriend and I recently went for dinner at de Kas. The space is beautiful if a little chilly designwise for my taste. I love the idea of the all the fresh food and that it is grown on site. Very inventive and creative. Our biggest complaint would be the SLOW service. Lots of staff running around looking busy but doing nothing. Certainly not coming by our table. At one point in time my boyfriend had to tackle a server and ask her where ours was.I know that we are not alone in this as the tables on either side of us felt the same. One American the other Scottish and we are Canadian.Worth a visit but just go forewarned.
265112846,50,"April 11, 2015",Fresh Ingredients Showcased with Skill,Take fresh organic produce grown on site (or their local farm) and add the skill to present them table side with imagination and flair to enhance all the flavors in providing a gastronomic delight. I'll tell you what ... this was a great meal! Get the wine pairing ... your taste buds will thank you. Very nice staff!
265006477,50,"April 11, 2015","Always different, always great...","I've been to De Kas twice now. Once (a few years ago), I came for a business dinner. The food was superb, the service attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere is wonderful.Last night, thanks to gift from a friend, my wife and I had the chance to try the chef's table. You sit inside the kitchen, talking with the chefs, and see how everyone's meal (including your own) is put together. Although the chef's table is certainly not something most people can afford to do, it's worth doing at least once in your life.You don't need to sit at the chef's table to have a great experience, but you can see from inside the kitchen just what makes De Kas such a wonderful place to enjoy dinner. They start with diverse locally sourced ingredients, typically seasonal. They handle the ingredients expertly, and try to unlock new experiences with familiar ingredients. They look at what's available at the standards they require, and develop the menu weekly to best highlight something special about each ingredient.This approach is best highlighted by this week's small celeriac dish. They served a slice of lightly cooked and seasoned slice of celeriac with a puree of celeriac and a granola, also made of celeriac. Each treatment made you think differently about something familiar. The puree, for example, highlighted the nuttiness in a way the granola didn't. Each treatment unlocked a new experience in something you've had a hundred times. Each dish we enjoyed was both familiar and surprising, and everything from start to finish was unfailingly excellent.The chefs work under high pressure and to high standards, but somehow remain friendly and relaxed throughout. If a timer goes off that requires someone to step away from one task, invariably a teammate swoops in to complete the task without a pause. A piece of fish that flakes into pieces while plating is laughingly and effortlessly transformed by the team into a unique and new dish for one of the staff to enjoy. They are obviously a tightly knit team who share a great love of food, and of the craft of preparing and serving food.On that note, the service and dining experience are also incredible. Our server was friendly, attentive, and greatly knowledgeable about the wines. The pacing of the food delivery is perfect, and not by accident. From the kitchen, you can see a master chart with the stage each table is at, and any special requirements. Wave after wave of courses are completed, assembled, and delivered just in time. The last dish to be delivered is prepared literally within seconds of the first.The atmosphere is also wonderful, and you can appreciate both the fading sunlight and the surrounding gardens from nearly every seat in the house.In short, De Kas provides a world-class dining experience that is always new and fresh, but consistently great."
264307678,50,"April 7, 2015",Interesting and well implemented concept,The restaurant is situated in a local park therefore the surrounding is very nice. The concept of changing menus is well implemented. The dishes offer a nice variation - even though you may not like everything. The service is great and so is also the atmosphere. It doesn't feel posh and you can really enjoy a good time here.
264242490,40,"April 7, 2015","Interesting, very interesting","An intriguing place this. The concept is an interesting one in that there is no menu, they just serve 3 courses based on what they have prepared (though they will change this if you have dietary requirements). This works well if you like what they serve...The food we ate was very well cooked but there were some odd flavours in there. So whilst I'd happily eat the lamb course again and again, the picked fennel was something I hope never again see on my plate. Of the 4 course we ate 2 were brilliant, one was OK and the 4th just plain odd, the 2 appetizers were also a 50/50 split in odd and wonderful. It's worth remembering this before you visit as even as someone who will basically try anything, I struggled with pickled turnip.On reflection, I'm pretty sure I'd go again but you have to have an open mind and be prepared for some non-standard stuff."
264189469,50,"April 7, 2015",Special dinner,"De Kas is a special place where people goes to enjoy food. Real food, organic, available only following seasons rules and... Love. I went there with a friend to celebrate my birthday, I knew you had to made a reservation, at least, a couple of days before. Despite the Wedsneday, the restaurant was plenty of people. Go there if you want to satisfy your taste end eye. Price between 55-60 euro p.p. (3 courses) and 100 euro for the super luxury dinner including cheese (4 courses + 2-3 wine qualities)."

The food was excellent, the venue amazing and the service perfect.The restaurant is set in a former greenhouse located in a lovely little park, making the experience unique. The food from starter to desert was excellent and surprising as left to the chef's will, using seasonal ingredients. The service was spot on too and the dishes explained to us as they were served. A great place to go and go again."
263841241,50,"April 5, 2015",one of the best meals we have ever experienced,"My wife and I recently spent our 22nd wedding anniversary at the chef's table at De Kas restaurant. The meal exceeded our expectation in every way: quality, service and value. Most of the ingredients are either grown at the restaurant or nearby at their farm. The flavors and freshness reflected the organic nature of their efforts. The chef's table experience was worth the effort scheduling early. After 10 courses: each personally described to us by the preparing member of the staff, we were given a personal tour of the facility and restaurant and then finished our final three courses sitting in the main open spaced dinning room.Everyone from the host, wait staff and head chef was down to earth and genuinely interested in providing and outstanding dinning experienceWe live in Las Vegas and frequent high end cuisine. This type of dining experience would be double the price in the states or more. The 15 minute taxi ride from the center of Amsterdam was well worth the effort. I was very impressed by the staff and the standard of food they prepare."

We were there on a spring day when it was raining sideways, but I'm still glad we went. Servers were very willing to address food allergies (can't have corn) and restrictions (don't eat meat or foul). I don't think I missed out on anything, as we had a beautiful mushroom soup, followed by a ceviche and a wonderfully flavorful salad made from celery root shaved to look like pasta, then a main course of the most buttery fish I've ever tasted, and closed with a fabulous assortment of tiny dessert bites (butter cake, dark chocolate, and a divine beet/violet gellee). The place was not crowded at lunchtime on a weekday, but we did reserve online in advance, just to be sure. Most other diners were businesspeople dressed in work attire. We wore slacks and sweaters. I think nice jeans would be OK, so long as one looks tidy. For the evening, I'd probably dress a bit better, but again, slacks and a sweater would do."

No ala carte, instead a delicious set menu was offered (no food decisions necessary :) Everything was 100% fresh & much of it from their own gardens. 15 mins outside central Amsterdam (take a cab there and back) and enjoy a feast here. The restaurant is located in a huge, buzzing greenhouse with a great atmosphere. The staff were well trained, friendly and spoke English perfectly, and many displayed a very 'English' (Dutch?) sense of sarcastic humour (which we enjoyed). My party had a great time there & we shall definitely return."
259569065,50,"March 15, 2015",Creative and flavorful with locally sourced ingredients,"Went with a group and a pre-selected six course menu of some of the most creative food combinations I have ever had ... for example, carrot canneloni was made using wide strips of carrots instead of a pasta roll. Each vegetable and fruit was extremely flavorful and perfectly seasoned and cooked (the tiny roasted brussels sprouts served in a bowl as a pre-meal snack were addictive and a healthy alternative to chips). Each course had an unusual but flavorful surprise, and the staff happily answered questions as we tried to guess ingredients (a pectin jelly had red pepper, rhubarb and cinnamon - intense flavor and the perfect between-course palate cleanser).The building is a large greenhouse set in a park-like setting, and the glass walls keep you from feeling crowded in.A unique place - try it !"
259200457,40,"March 12, 2015",The restaurant itself is the star here,"The restaurant itself is the star here. It is a converted glasshouse situated in a lovely wooded park which is accessible only by foot. The decor is modern, fresh and the table layouts are well done. While it was freezing outside, the inside temperature was just right. The staff were also a highlight. Very friendly and knowledgeable.Now for the negative. We thought the food was not matching the quality of the restaurant. I understand the concept of using local fresh produce but I thought the 3 course meal was lacking slightly in flavor. The presentation was excellent for all courses but my taste buds were let down.At 50 Euros starting price for the 3 courses I expected much more. This restaurant could be world class if the menu could be tweaked."
258282074,40,"March 7, 2015",Very good interesting menu,"A half hour trip on the number 9 tram from Centraal station, this restaurant is very smart and spruce in a glasshouse complete with storks nesting on top of a nearby pillar in the park beyond.It seats a large number of people and this does keep noise levels relatively high. I wouldn't count this as a romantic location. Service was great. The food was very good, but not quite a five given the cost.I would eat their again, but there are better restaurants in Amsterdam in my opinion."

From the moment we walked into the restaurant we were taken aback by the setting and attention to detail.We opted for the set menu, which is kept a secret until it is bought out to the tables. We also had wine pairings for each course. Our tastebuds were taken on a fascinating journey through the courses. We were not over-fed like with so many set-menus. Instead, the food was well prepared with a focus on flavours and quality.We all particularly enjoyed the waitresses descriptions of each dish, and discussion of where the food was grown and how many 'food-miles' we would be eating.A true gem to be explored and visited!"
257836171,40,"March 5, 2015",Very impressive,"Enjoyed dinner at de Kas on a Wednesday evening. We were unable to book on the restaurant website but our hotel concierge sorted a table at short notice.No menu but a special chef's presentation of what is in season at the time. Inventive, creative, ever so tasty food. We had the accompanying wines which went very well with the food.The dining room is visually impressive, and even though it was a Weds evening there was a good buzz in the place - I can imagine it's packed Thurs, Fri and Sat!My only gripe is the service, which was friendly but slow. However it was pointed out to me that life in Amsterdam is generally very laid back - c'est la vie!"
257529356,50,"March 3, 2015",Food that dances in your mouth.,"The location was an oasis of calm beside a little canal; you'd think you were in the countryside. Yes! Even in the heart of Amsterdam! You cross a little bridge and step into the ambience of a nursery/farm.The building was a greenhouse, transformed into an elegant and modern space: roomy, open, simple, clean, bright, straight forward and meltingly warm on the cold night when I was there. All was of top quality, including the table linen and service.The food was exceptional and unusual. I was inspired to eat slowly to savour the unexpected combinations. The unique flavours were varied and complex. Several of the food items were new to me (the underground root portion of the chicory, for example). The chef understood what it is to build a diet from plants! This was so terribly satisfying, even relieving, for me as a vegetarian.The food all originates from the greenhouse next door, or from the larger greenhouse close by where the restaurant owner tends the crops and brings in the harvest every morning. Organic. Fresh. Delicious. It was fun to be able to watch the busy kitchen behind the glass wall while eating.Service was friendly and professional.I loved being able to tour the greenhouse and taking an organic apple proffered in the huge bowl as I left.This restaurant is a good choice for a special occasion when you have something to celebrate."

257271826,30,"March 2, 2015",Mixed review...,"Having been on the fence about whether to De Kas for a few years, I finally decided to book a table for the third visit. I wish I had seen *what I am about to write* before I made the decision.The walk thru the park to get to the restaurant was delightful with many different types of birds around (side note: they seem to be a bit ""early"" in freezing beginning of March). The restaurant was beautiful.What is worse? A restaurant that doesn't care or one that thinks it is doing great things? I will give the staff at De Kas benefit of the doubt and give them credit for trying... although the service was at the same time polite and indifferent.Almost as soon as we sat down, we were given olives and another dish of mustard-marinated mini Brussel sprouts. Feeling peckish, we started to eat and they were tasty. The mustard pairing was nice, the olives seem to have been marinated in something zesty- nice. We were given an explanation of how the tasting menu worked: it was already chosen for us.First course was a light soup that came in two parts: ingredients in a bowl and then broth poured over from a glass teapot. At the same time, a small plate of sweet potato crisps were brought out. So far so good.The soup might have been a bit light in terms of ingredients quantity. But it was curiously tasted and beautifully presented, and soon finished. It was immediately asked to be taken away but to our surprise, the unfinished brussel sprouts and crisps were also removed (but not the olives).Next came a salmon dish with an arrangement of vegetables and creamed blue cheese. Not a common combination but worked ok. The salmon was meant to be cooked on the outside, slightly raw on the inside. I felt they had taken it off the heat too soon; the fish was practically raw with the outside JUST seared. Considering it is smoked fish, they are off the hook but it could have been nicer.The dishes were hurriedly removed and suddenly there was nowhere for me to place the very large olive stone I was left with. On the white tablecloth or in the napkin on my lap? They have also not done anything about the empty bread basket (we ate our 2 slices).We waited and started to wonder if that was the full meal. We checked our menu again to reconfirm; 2 courses or 3 courses??Eventually another fish dish was brought to us. Only now were we asked whether we wanted more bread. Given that the main was there, we no longer needed to fill our time with bread...This main dish worked well for me because the fish was cooked tender, and very tasty with the capers, anchovies, and mashed potatoes. I just thought it was unusual to serve two fish dishes in a row. The menu would have worked better with a meat starter or all-vegetable starter. Or skip the salmon altogether and give dessert instead.We did not feel the meal was worth 39 Euros. If the issues listed above were fixed, then maybe I'd pay 30 Euros next time. Lots of potential of a restaurant but management will have to act if they want to be above-average. When we left the restaurant, we saw a mouse running out in the open :("

Cross the little bridge that takes you into the park and you will find a delightful restaurant/greenhouse. The ambience is superb and ideal for anything from business lunches to social dinners with friends. The food is top quality and the produce, picked directly from the greenhouse is incredibly fresh. The restaurant offers a very good wine list. I always try and drink local wine while travelling, and so we selected an absolutely delicious fresh, lively and fruity white Dutch wine. We had the ""surprize"" lunch menu proposed by the chef, that included three starters, a couple of main dishes, and a fantastic dessert, a kind of mousse with different layers of fruit and chocolate. I have definitely added De Kas Restaurant to my ""must go"" places to eat in Amsterdam!"
256450701,50,"February 25, 2015",Good In Every Way,"There's not much to say about perfection. Food, wine,service, fresh produce - all local. For a unique dining experience inside what looks like a glasshouse, De Kas is where you want to go. Pricey but worth it."
256207319,50,"February 24, 2015",Probably my most unusual dinner ever,"""Unusual"" is the word that would desribe the best my dinner there. It's pretty hard to explain how they cook but it's an unusual combination of tastes and products, unexpected but a very pleasant surprise. Even the wine was unusual! I ordered a Sancerre that did not taste like the classic Sancerre as it was a non-filtered wine.Service is very good and location... unusual!Price wise, i find De Kas reasonable considering the quality you get and also the quantity (3 more or less small different dishes as starter and the main course was generous). Service was very good.Book it and experince yourself, i'm sure you'll be surprised and not disapointed!"
256155651,50,"February 24, 2015",de Kas...de lovely,We had lunch at this restaurant...easy to reach by no 9 tram from Centraal. The food is locally sourced and quite delicious. Each component was excellent however sometimes it was hard to follow the 'story' of the dish. A stand out was the beautiful smoked salmon - almost mousse like texture and also the ginger and carrot soup starter with blue cheese ravioli. The service was friendly and efficient ... everything was explained well. The setting is extraordinary... in a greenhouse in a park - quite lovely!
256023363,50,"February 23, 2015",Well worth the tram ride,"A no 9 tram ride from the centre of town will see you into a little park square. In one corner is de Kas, a greenhouse. The staff were excellent (even providing the recipe for the roasted and marinaded sprout starter).The food is what the chef decides and all of it was to die for. We had lunch with dessert and wine. It is not cheap but it is good value for money.The range of flavours and the juxtapositions of ingredients were really a marvel of ingenuity by the chef. It was great to see them slaving away in the kitchen - shame we hadn't booked to eat in there - perhaps next time.A very pleasant 2 hours partly spent learning that beetroot as part of a dessert DOES work!If you like fine dining in unusual surroundings, this is the place for you."
255798493,50,"February 22, 2015",Fascinating culinary experience,"If you are looking for exceptional food and unusual interior, this is a place to go in Amsterdam. The name translates into English as 'greenhouse', and it is a perfect description of the restaurant.The interior looks very modern and upscale, much better than I expected, despite the fact that a part of the building is a real greenhouse, where they grow produce. For dinner they only serve a three course set menu and you don't know what your courses are. The food was outstanding, of excellent quality. I loved the juicy and tender veal as well as the starters. The desert was good too, but the beetroot in it was not to my taste. I highly recommend this restaurant and deserves a Micheline star!"
255284837,20,"February 19, 2015",Not the same De Kas,"I have to start out by saying this has always been one of my favorite dining experiences.My husband and I were recently in Amsterdam and were quite excited about going back to De Kas, but sadly we were very disappointed.From the beginning the appetizers were tasteless and the vegetables were over-cooked. We also did the wine pairings and we're not impressed by those either.The restaurant is beautiful, both in the day and evening but sadly I don't think we will be going back."
255231128,40,"February 19, 2015",Excellent choice,"I ate here twice and found it extremely nice. It is a big space, with excellent service. Staff are really helpful, from reception to table service and food/wine recommendation. The first time I went we also did a tour of the place, it was really special. Prices are high, but you can control that with the menu selection. Absolutely recommend it for any occasion, whether it's business or a romantic meal"
254714132,50,"February 17, 2015",A birthday dinner to remember,"We went here as a special treat for my mother and sister. We traveled from Eindhoven and it's easy to get to by public transport which was nice as we all could enjoy the wine. The atmosphere is fantastic and the concept great. We are into local food so it pleased us. We started with local bubbly wine which for me was the only not so good part of the whole dinner. There is no menu which I found oddly calming. No choice-angst this time. What particularly struck me was the extremely pleasant acoustics. Despite the size of the room it felt intimate, it was easy to hear the rest of our 6 people party and we never heard the conversations of neighboring tables. A real gem."
254280083,50,"February 15, 2015",Very nice place to celebrate,"We went there for a business event. Excellent atmosphere, which suits this occasion, but also for an evening out with your partner. The service is top and the food good. Definite a place to come back."

Tasty beetroot homemade pasta. Sweet, fresh homegrown carrots - heaven for a vegetarian.Blood orange sorbet really delicious, though I'd suggest this is more of a standalone desert. Perhaps one flavour sensation too many with the chocolate crumble, beetroot and vanilla / citrus foam.Presentation excellent.Only down side was that it took a while to get the bill at the end of the meal. No drama, just slow when you're ready to leave."
253952769,50,"February 13, 2015",What a treat again!,"Nearly forgot the place but now definitely back on the map! Had a party for two and our anniversary to celebrate and had bubbles as an aperitif and guess what....the bubbles were Dutch and delicious! The concept of De Kas restaurant & nursery is that the food is prepared with the freshest, local ingredients, and they grow their own herbs and vegetables in the greenhouses and gardens at the restaurant and on their farmland in the Beemster area. There's a set menu based on the daily harvest, supplemented with the best additional ingredients from local suppliers and you're asked whether you're are vegetarian, flexitarian (like we are) or whether you've got a food allergy.Great staff and service in a great location.....a huge greenhouse which dates back to 1926."

I'll admit their straight-forward, fixed menu worried me slightly at first, but we were asked for food likes/dislikes (and any allergies), and the menu was altered to meet our directions.All of the food was presented beautifully, and the wine pairings (optional) matched each course nicely.The space is done beautifully, keeping the original architectural elements of the greenhouse, but adding eco-friendly solar panels and lighting. Each of the staff were friendly and helpful, all of which contributed to our very enjoyable experience!"

250171203,50,"January 20, 2015",Unique and spectacular,"This is a well-known place in the Netherlands, I wanted to visit since a long time, but only recently managed to do it. I loved every bit of it: the atmosphere is unique (dining in a glasshouse), the staff was very friendly (in casual way), and the food was delicious. We had duck as main course, which was one of the best dishes I ever ate. So tasty. The restaurant is a bit out of town, but easy to reach with a taxi. It's definitely worth the trip, I can highly recommend it."
250063087,50,"January 19, 2015",Straightforward and incredible ...,"We made a booking at De Kas based upon a recommendation in a Lonely Planet guide. We were a little hesitant as it looks a little pretentious and half expected to feel out of place. Thankfully we were largely incorrect and proved wrong.It's a little out of the centre in an unlikely neighbourhood, but the park itself is a perfect setting. After walking past the greenhouses we were greeted by very friendly staff and shown to our table in the middle of the large greenhouse.The menu options consisted of a three course fixed price menu, or a more expensive menu including a number of complementary wines. As we aren't big drinkers were opted for the first option. The menu choices were at the chef's discretion and we were happy to be surprised.The first course consisted of dishes containing pumpkin, beetroot and venison. The main course was primarily veal and fennel. For dessert we had a small ginger cake with a carrot sorbet. Each course tasted absolutely fantastic. All of the flavours were really intense and shone through.For drinks we opted for the house wines; one of us red, the other white. They were great choices and went well with the food.Simply; this restaurant is superb. Sure, it's a little pricey but as a treat it can't be missed. Some of the clientele are definitely not the sort of people I'd site down and have a pint with (maybe my issue), but for the food and experience don't think twice ... and the staff are great."
248656471,40,"January 10, 2015","Fresh, fresh, fresh...",This is the second time we have been to De Kas and it was as good as last time. The decor and environment is stunning from black ceiling and neon lights to perfectly placed tables and fantastic tableware. We had the full menu with accompanying wine and it was as fresh as it was pulled from the ground. Nothing is over cooked and tastes perfect. They have a real knack of getting amazing flavours and textures from vegetables. A must do when in Amsterdam.
248386699,50,"January 8, 2015",Essential Amsterdam!,"You approach the restaurant through a slightly over grown (in a nice way) park. Eventually you come across what appears to be a glasshouse, which turns out to be an amazing restaurant.They have a large garden that supplies a lot of the food on the menu, and a lot more is sourced from local farmers. I guess because of this, everything tastes extremely fresh.There didn't appear to be any menus, I believe the menu is altered daily and you get what you're given. What we were given was five courses of mind blowing and unusual but delicious concoctions. Each course was accompanied by a wine match as well as a detailed description of the food by the most amusing and attentive waiter I've ever met.We were fortunate enough to begin our visit in the early evening when it was still light, and as the meal went on, we could watch the sky get darker (sitting in a glasshouse remember)."
248120047,50,"January 7, 2015",Delicious,"Holy moly what a meal! This restaurant will ruin vegetables for you forever.This restaurant (as you may already know) is situated inside a greenhouse, and their philosophy is all about locally sourced vegetables as the highlight to every meal. Their summer meals are 90+% locally sourced, and their winter meals are 60+% locally sourced. They grow a lot of the fruits and vegetables they use in the greenhouse as well as on a local farm run by the owners of this restaurant.Each meal is a fixed price 3 course meal, highlighting local seasonal vegetables with available accomodations for allergies or other requirements. The menu will change from day to day or week to week depending on what's available locally. There is also an option for wine pairings (2 wines or 4 wines) with each meal. In addition, there is an extensive wine list if you'd like to order something a la carte.The location is a bit south (2-3 miles) from the central part of Amsterdam, but it's an easy bike ride (on a nice day) or taxi ride at night or on a cold day. If you're wondering, yes it totally is worth the trip. There is plenty of bike parking right outside the restaurant. If it's a nice day and you're early for your reservation (or have some time afterwards), it's a lovely walk around the greenhouse - complete with a pond and a bridge and lots of greenery through a paved pathway.The service here is wonderful, and the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu items and where all the ingredients are sourced from. The meal is served at a slow pace, and each dish is introduced as it is brought out.Our meal for the evening started with some root vegetables, then a soup, two vegetable appetizers, a main dish (duck with vegetables), and dessert (rhubarb pie and compote with ice cream).A delightful meal, a wonderful experience, you need to eat here."
247760151,40,"January 6, 2015",Beautiful experience,"Modern atmosphere, diligent staff and excellent cuisine, but we would love a little more warmth and some fanciness sometimes. We enjoyed a fixed menu for lunch, with extremely fresh ingredients (mostly grown around the restaurant), clever texture mixes, perfect cookings and beautiful dish set-up, with also a nice choice of wines by the glass. Definitely a must see - must do in Amsterdam !We would love to come back for dinner and enjoy the table in the kitchen."
247573723,50,"January 5, 2015","The location, food, restaurant is simply amazing!!","I booked this for the special lunch for my partner and I.It was a way out from the central hotel we were staying in in Amsterdam, although it's only a tram ride away and really easy to find.We got there slightly early and they allowed us to come in and seated us.It was a set menu which was ok, although I probably wouldn't have ordered what was on the menu if I had the choice however I was glad it was that way afterwards.The courses were simply divine, it was full of different flavours and cooked to perfection. The fact that it was all cooked on location is another adding benefit. Its set in a quiet park and you can sit outside and look over the flower beds and plots.I cannot fault this at all, it was a new experience for me and its certainly one that I would go back to. It was amazing, and if it was for Trip Advisor I wouldn't have found this hidden gem so thank you!!!Special occasions, take/treat your partner to this its something they wont forget in a hurry! I certainly wont!"

A site should not miss in during your visit in Amsterdam"
244941595,50,"December 18, 2014",Truly memorable experience,"Beautiful setting in the park, in a wonderful, light conservatory. Greenhouses everywhere which you're free to wander, providing herbs, tomatoes and peppers.On arrival, we were presented with delicious bread, olives and marinated turnips. Selection of starters arrived together - wonderful fennel dish (roasted fennel, fresh shaved fennel, orange and edible flowers). Also a roasted vegetable (i think?) with pepper and sweetcorn salsa - one came with roasted lamb for the meat eaters and the other with miniature filo parcels for the vegetarian. Followed by an amazing tomato broth with sourdough croutons.Main coursesGrilled plaice with seafood, courgettes, pickled cucumbers, courgette flowers, pea shoots.Vegetarian similar with puff pastry things?Excellent dessert - chocolate nemesis.

242816408,50,"December 3, 2014",Outstanding,My wife and I had dinner at De Kas whilst visiting Amsterdam for our 2nd wedding anniversary. From start to finish we had an absolutely amazing experience. We were given a tour of the greenhouses which was full of a wonderful variety of their own grown produce. Each course was fantastic and the staff were courteous and polite. We sat in the main greenhouse and it was beautifully lit with the dark outside. The wine pairings all matched perfectly and I can not recommend it highly enough.
241621839,30,"November 26, 2014",Our expectations were not met,"We visited on a bright sunny Monday lunchtime in November so able to experience the lovely building and its parkland setting. The menu is not cheap 18euro for starter courses (3 dishes to share) and 20 euro for main and we expected something wonderful from reviews - but didn't get it. Our waitress barely smiled and we did not feel very valued as customers. Some snacks were on the table - chunks of carrot, lightly cooked but no very tasty dressing and enormous chewy green olives. The starters were a jerusalem artichoke soup -tasty enough with some chunks of octopus and 2 vegetable dishes to share. One included brussel sprouts and the other a dark green cabbage. I am one of the people who finds these very bitter (genetics apparently) and the 2 wedges of cabbage had been charred to a level of charcoal which was frankly unpleasant. The main course was decent enough - a generous portion of fish with some vegetables and a lemony sauce. Nothing special or outstanding. No room for dessert. Wines by the glass were reasonably priced. We have no wish to return."
241200815,40,"November 23, 2014",very nice experience,The setting was amazing! The atmosphere very relaxed. The staff was very nice and quick to help. And the food was honest and very tastfull. Very good price quality value!
240577133,50,"November 19, 2014",Fun for all the (grown up) family!,"My wife took me and our 4 ""children"" here while in Amsterdam for a major birthday celebration, and it was a great success! The setting is unusual, in a good way; a wide, high and airy ""dining room"", which is, in reality a smart new greenhouse, with modern furniture, crockery and cutlery (so, at the other end of the spectrum from higgledy piggledy, mix and match approach at The Petersham Nursery in Richmond in the UK). Tables were well spaced apart, and the whole area is lit with clean, modern lighting.All this just provides a lovely, fun, setting, within which the delightful young waiting staff made us feel welcome and well looked after, as we were served a highly original meal. The 5 course menu is fixed; our waitress offered to tell us what we were to have, or let each dish be a surprise. We chose the surprise, and De Kas suggested appropriate wine parings based on us only wanting two bottles. In total, there were three ""starter"" courses, a main and pudding. And each course was interesting, tasty and unusual. We think its nice to eat out somewhere that you eat something that you wouldn't cook (better, sometimes!) at home; that's what De Kas did in spades. And all from produce that was, they assured us, locally produced.In all, De Kas provided a fun meal in an unusual setting, and we loved it!"
240344556,20,"November 18, 2014",Not worth it.,"The place is very nice and unique. Unfortunately the food is disappointing- we've paid for 3 course menu 49.50 Euros and received a bitter salad, a chicken breast and a beat rout dessert- that we just couldn't eat."
240293986,50,"November 17, 2014",Greenhouse wonder,"How great is it to eat food that is grown on site? How great is it to eat food that doesn't make you feel guilty? How great is it to eat food that you would never eat at home, but that looks so simple to make and tastes so subtle? How great is to eat delicate nearly totally organic food from a set menu in a stunning setting?It is all great at De Kas."
240262362,50,"November 17, 2014",Wonderful place,"When in Amsterdam, go here. Don't think about it. Don't double check reviews. Just make a reservation and go.It's fresh in-season ingredients, mostly from their own garden, made into a dish created by the chef for that day. The food couldn't be more perfect.The restaurant is set on a the grounds of a park inside a green house. Great light in the dining room (it's all glass!), and great decor. Very nicely done.Their approach to service is also pleasantly relaxed; not inattentive, just relaxed. They were running around, but didn't make us feel like things were rushed. We sat there for 1.5 hours for lunch. They spaced out drinks, appetizers, and entrees so perfectly that it didn't really feel like 1.5 hours. I would generally be annoyed if my lunch took that long, but they made it feel right. And they were in no rush to get us out; we could have easily sat there for another half hour without anyone bothering us.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner in Amsterdam. It's a little pricey, but well worth the money."
240059529,50,"November 16, 2014",Organic contemporary glasshouse excellence,"The number 9 tram swishes you out of the centre of Amsterdam past the Tropenmuseum and on to the Hogeweg tram stop. From there you can see glittering coloured lights inside an amazing contemporary glasshouse in a park. Follow the footbridge over the canal, and lights guide your path to the entrance. Inside, to the left are crops growing, including herbs and tomatoes. The concept is simple: farm to table, either from the glasshouse here or their farm half an hour outside Amsterdam.The central dining glasshouse is large, modern and comfortable, with well placed and spaced tables. The kitchen is open plan and you can see the brigade working away at the preparation and cooking. The menu is a 'surprise' in that they make the best of the available seasonal ingredients in a no choice menu, but in our experience they accommodate effortlessly to dietary requirements like seafood allergies or diabetics. There is also a wine pairing with the menu if you wish. The staff are the key to the delivery of the quality experience and are attentive, knowledgeable, and positively delight in enthusing about each course as it is delivered.We have been here a number of times in the last decade and always found the experience and the food positively excellent, great ingredients served in imaginative ways through all the courses. Last time there was a lovely velvety Jerusalem artichoke soup with squid, delightful salads of beetroots, and sautéed cabbage slices and mushrooms with enticing dressings, and a superb pork loin main course. The cheese course had some new varieties for me, all in perfect room temperature condition, then the dessert had the table oohing and aahing to conclude. Very special. Always busy so book ahead.And will all restaurants have to be like this in the future?"

Reserve in advance as we had a had time getting reservation for dinner during our week's stay. The ambiance is amazing, its very unusual, open and trendy. Loved their veges garden! The menu was set so you don't get to pick but they do ask for your preferences so if you dislike something very much they will leave it out of the dish. My husband is gluten free and they brought some nice gluten free bread. Since we were there in the fall beets were dominating our dishes which is fine with me as i like well prepared beets but it may not be to everyone's taste. Dishes had lots of veges and i love that but were not overly flavorful, except for the desert. The layered desert was so light and tasty with great fall flavor to it. The service was great, recommendations on the wine were ok. It was fair priced for this organic food of this quality. We would definitely return here!"
238267212,50,"November 5, 2014",This is how to do it!,"Our travel guide has a small remark about an organic ""greenhouse"" restaurant a bit outside the city center, where they grew their own vegetables. Our curiosity was instantly sparked, to us that sounds like a perfect restaurant! It was easy to get there with the number 9 tram from the center. I'll say right away that the experience was above all expectations. This is a serious, modern, well-run restaurant worthy of at least one star in my opinion. The setting inside a huge glass house, inside a beautiful park was spectacular, and next to to the eating area was the actual greenhouse where veggies were being grown. The staff was professional and very friendly and helpful. We had a really great time with our main waiter, Edwin, who also took us on a tour of the greenhouse after our meal. We took the 3-course set lunch menu, together with the ""small"" wine tasting menu (one glass for each course). To start with, though, we couldn't resist when they asked if we wanted some Dutch ""champagne"" from South Holland. It was really good, made on the champenoise method with Riesling grapes. Later we also tasted a Dutch Pinot Grigio from limburg, which was excellent. The first course was a red beet soup with an oyster from Zeeland. This is a fantastic combination, and I had already had something similar elsewhere, but the De Kas version was better than anything I had tried before. Heavenly. Afterwards we got a plate with various cooked vegetables in creative versions and sauces/foams which were amazing. The main course was a flat fish which was delicious, with fantastic garnish. The dessert was also super fresh and tasted great, with some super tasty orange berries I had never eaten before. It was a great meal, which left us feeling invigorated and extremely content. After we left, we took a walk in the beautiful park. The total for 2 persons including ""champagne"" aperitif and 3 glasses of wine each came to 167 euros. Well worth it. The best meal I have had in a long time."

I had no idea what to expect, but what a breath of fresh air to experience a meal in the beautifully appointed light and bright restaurant with lovely park surroundings.A warm welcome and attentive service by friendly and knowledgeable wait staff along with the most delicious and cleverly flavoursome food made this an occasion to remember.I'll not spoil the surprise for you and let you discover this gem for yourself, but suffice to say this is a must when visiting Amsterdam.

Then to live up to this title, De Kas must have to really deliver. And it does!Discovered this place in 2001. Have been trying to go eat there once every season ever since. Of course since I travel a lot, this is not always possible. But they do strive to please and I am a huge fan.The point of eating there every season is because they procure fresh seasonal, locally grown ingredients. So they vary according to the time of the year. There is no set menu - the produce of each day makes its way to the table - cooked and blended skillfully with perfect complements, also skillfully matched with wines ( if desired).Since the legend goes that they had a frequent guest who was vegetarian, they have figured the veg option down to a T.The service is exceptional and they are proud of their establishment - this is clear.A bit pricey - but unforgettable for a special occasion or just for an indulgent extravagant meal!"

234638450,10,"October 15, 2014",Beautiful setting/Disappointing menu,"Arriving by cab, we were impressed with the beauty of the large greenhouse in the park setting. As you walk in the front door you can see all the beautiful plants growing inside the greenhouse. That is where the positive experience ended.We were taken to our table in the middle of the very large room. We were a party of four. Most of the remainder of the tables in this room were set for six to twelve people. As the room began to fill, many large parties were seated all around us. I was not aware that it was a fixed menu only. You had a choice of two entrees and the starter and dessert were fixed. The choice for the main course was duck or a white fish of some sort. The only other option was a vegetable dish. The couple we were dining with ordered the vegetarian dish because they didn't want to have the duck or the fish and so they found their vegetarian dish very unsatisfying.The first course was a fish soup which was tasty. The second course arrived and it looked pretty but it was full of beets (which I don't eat) and edible flowers. I don't eat duck but my husband chose that and it was served blood rare and tough to chew. I ordered the fish which was bland with almost no taste. My fish plate was served with beets so I left them on the plate.(Apparently there must have been an abundance of beets growing in the greenhouse because they were featured in the salad and the main courses.) The dessert was a scoop of homemade ice cream and little bits of broken up brownies sprinkled on the plate. There was also a slice of pear and some pear puree on the dessert plate. I suppose this was supposed to look fancy but it looked ridiculous. You had to pick up the small bits of brownie with a spoon. The presentation was completely unappetizing.As we were leaving we walked by the kitchen, which is open to view, and the dishes were lined up all being plated exactly alike, like you see at a catered event.Overall this restaurant was very disappointing and is very overrated. Dinner was expensive and definitely not worth the price.We have friends that will soon be visiting Amsterdam and we will strongly discourage them from eating in this pretentious restaurant."
234511429,50,"October 15, 2014",Absolute great quality food in fantastic setting,"Vegetables direct from the restaurant's own land, you can't get it fresher and you will taste the difference. No menu, you eat what the cook prepares. Wine is offered in line with the food. The setting is an old, large greenhouse. Absolutely amazing concept! Great service, staff with eye for detail. Simply a must when you visit Amsterdam."
233168451,50,"October 7, 2014",Greenhouse special which is a must,"This is definitely one of the highlights of our dining experiences in Amsterdam. Easy to get to with a taxi and it seems that the drivers all know about this special restaurant inside the garden. Wonderful experience to be in a huge glasshouse with lots of open spaces although it was chilly outside and not too much sunlight when we got there for lunch. No menu in sight and the friendly waitress basically asked if there is anything that we don't eat. I asked for a vegetarian option and she gladly said of course as they have their own garden and it is not a problem. The pickled beetroot was very fresh and not sour at all and the dip was also good with bread. The soup was wonderful and we also got 2 cold/ warm appetizers - warm salad and vegetable 'lasagne'. Very tasty. Even my husband was surprised with the freshness and taste from these vegetarian dishes. The mains were a perfect white perch for my husband and risotta rolls for me. Both well executed and did not disappoint. By the time we finished every single bit of food on our dishes, we were stuffed and could not do the desserts. We also had the chance to tour around the gardens and definitely could identify some of the greens from the garden on our plate. Top marks for all around. Prices were reasonable in our opinion - Euro 39 each for lunch. With such high quality food and service, I would certainly recommend any foodie to make a trip there to enjoy this special place."
233007624,50,"October 7, 2014",Stunning,"One of the best anywhere! The attention to every detail shows in the finished product. Every dish was perfectly prepared and matched with wine. The idea of using the freshest and in season with menu changing daily is one that is hard to find , as you eat what the chef chooses. Worked for us better than having choices of less fresh food. Setting in a greenhouse in a park made this dinner over the top."
232761504,50,"October 5, 2014","amazing ambiance, delicious food",de kas came highly recommended from friends. It lives up to it's reputation and then some. Beautiful space. Every course is a delight and the wine pairings are for sure a must. It really feels like 'a walk through the garden' fresh and delicious. From beginning to end a an amazing experience - compliments to the entire de kas team!

231790089,50,"September 30, 2014",A reminder of the goodness of fresh produce!,"Its so easy for us all to get caught up in buying pre packaged foods, take away, and ready to eat meals in the hustle and bustle of our busy lives. De Kas is a perfect reminder for those of us who are guilty of the above, of how much better home grown produce is!From the beginning of the 2 course meal, my boyfriend and I were shooting each other looks of delight from across the table. That food was INCREDIBLE. We ate from the lunch menu, which includes 2 courses. The price is most definitely worth it. We even ordered dessert after our main because we couldn't get enough of the flavours and the freshness, and were so intrigued at the look of the beetroot and chocolate inspired dessert. This is a must do in Amsterdam. Hire a bike, ride there from central, take in the views of your surroundings, and enjoy being able to look up at the sky while you have your lunch in the comfort of the greenhouse.The staff were friendly, the atmosphere was relaxing and elegant, the food was divine ... what more could one ask for? It ticked all the boxes!"

230497566,50,"September 23, 2014",Unique food experience in a greenhouse,"It was worth thrip by tram into the suburbs of Amsterdam to find De Kas. We arrived early for lunch so had time to stroll around the vegetable gardens meticulously and interestingly laid out around the restaurant. The interiors did not disappoint either providing a relaxing, modern and enticing eating environment. The service was efficient, friendly and professional. We chose a light lunch menu and were more than satisfied, interesting combinations of ingredients and all fresh with a major focus on kms zero. I will return for dinner next time as it was the most exciting and adventurous food experience we found in Amsterdam"
229254707,50,"September 16, 2014",Incredible dining experience in a greenhouse,"De Kas is the type of restaurant you go to on a special occasion. Everything about the restaurant is special. The restaurant is in a greenhouse is in a beautiful park in the outskirts of Amsterdam. You walk about 200 yards from the road, through the park over a bridge to the restaurant. We made reservations about 2 weeks in advance by emailing the restaurant directly. They confirmed and reconfirmed the reservation 3 times. There is no menu and they will not even tell you what you are getting until it is served to you. They only serve the freshest ingredients. There is a 2-part starter (hot and cold), main course, cheese course and dessert followed by petit fours. All the food was delicious. The portions are small, but numerous so you will not go hungry. The wine pairings were very interesting with wines from Serbia, Bulgaria and other unique locations. The service was amazing. We had a main waitress, but no less than 10 other servers came to our table during the meal. Taxi ride home was very easy, they push a button, give you a slip of paper with a number and the taxi arrives in about 5 minutes. By far, this is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to."
228511989,50,"September 12, 2014",Special Experience,"Remarkable dining experience that absolutely lived up to it's advance reviews. Stunning sense of place, lovely three corse menu featuring hake and a gorgeous soup starter paired with obscure but very well conceived wines from Germany, Austria, and Italy. We had a fresh highly energetic young waiter named Edwin who helped make the experience so much fun. Dazzling from start to finish, not to be missed"
227755310,50,"September 8, 2014",Outstanding experience.,I booked the chefs table for myself and my wife's 10 year anniversary. All I can say is wow - and I have eaten in some great restaurants in my time. All of the kitchen team went out of their way to make us feel welcome and part of the kitchen. We had a great view of the kitchen and were assaulted by various wonderful smells. The food just kept on coming - we lost track of the number of courses - I think 7 or 8 in total. We both were really full by the end. It all tasted wonderful and was presented beautifully. They also fully catered to my wife who is vegetarian. The chefs table menu was slightly different to the main restaurant menu. The setting is also stunning. It is really easy to reach from Amsterdam.One final note - although expensive - for the experience I felt it was excellent value. When I booked they quoted me a chef's table price which included matching wines. I emailed them a few days prior to say my wife doesn't really drink and could they prepare some non alcoholic drinks. They replied that this was no problem. I think my wife must have still had at least half of the alcoholic pairings. I fully expected to pay the original quoted price for both of us. When the bill came I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had drastically reduced it and not charged my wife for any of the alcoholic drinks.One of the best meal experiences of my life.
227321668,50,"September 6, 2014",Best in Amsterdam,"So far this has definitely been the best restaurant I have visited in Amsterdam. Fresh delicious food, great wine matches, excellent service, beautiful building in a lovely location. It's a bit difficult to get to, but well worth the effort. Book ahead, there's no point just turning up, this place is booked out. I thought this was excellent value for money too."
226720764,40,"September 3, 2014",A Great Experience; Well Worth the Trip,"Yes, you can take the #9 tram from Spui out to De Kas in Frankendael Park. But I am pretty sure that if you can afford $225 for dinner for two, you can handle the $60 round trip taxi fare.Kidding aside, this is a lovely restaurant and a wonderful overall experience. Well worth the trip to its site in the southeastern part of the city. Take your glass of wine and tour their greenhouse. It's really just for show, but you can see many of the vegetables and herbs they use in their dishes and grow in bulk on a plot of land outside the city.The service was great. Like other top places in the city, it is fixed price, fixed menu with your choice of the number of courses. The salad was incredible! Unbelievably fresh greens, herbs and tomatoes. The other dishes were, in our view, overly complex. Too many elements in each one. (See my current review of Restaurant Johannes. Same complex approach.)They will call you a taxi to take you back to your hotel. No problem there. Dinner for two with 4 glasses of wine was about $225."
226370553,50,"September 2, 2014","Chic, understated excellence","My husband took me for lunch, on the recommendation of a good friend. de Kas is easy to get to (Tram 9 from Centraal Station) and has a glorious setting in a small park.The venue is chic and understated, the attention to detail faultless, and the service and cooking of the very highest standard.We enjoyed starters which were bursting with flavour and freshness, and a main course chicken dish which zinged and had a terrific light vinaigrette dressing. Wine by the glass was well-judged. We shared a dessert - plum cake, fennel ice-cream - which was sensational.Although the surroundings and presentation are not as fussy, the focus on local ingredients (from the next-door garden and greenhouse) and the cooking and presentation which focused on the food itself, reminded me of le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons.I thought it was a terrific lunch, and look forward to booking dinner there. Very soon, I hope!"
226191026,50,"September 1, 2014",Very good!,"We went here with friends whilst on a visit to amsterdam - it did not disappoint. Service excellent, food was wonderful - would highly recommend"
225937046,50,"September 1, 2014",Sublime,"Did a bit of research before we arrived in Amsterdam and booked De Kas a few weeks before. Glad we did, we managed to increase our booking from 2 to 4 as friends came up from a The Hague. Accessed it by a little bridge of the main road and was instantly in a calm serene park . The huge glass greenhouse was so impressive and not a sound could be heard as we entered, quiet we said to each but the acoustic were such that upon opening the door the buzz was warming.The hassle of choosing is taken out of your hands and we had an amazing meal . Sharing starters of produce from the garden and greenhouse we were actually sat in. We had a beetroot salad with three different types and another salad of fennel tomatoes and courgette. Warm soup with a piece of gurnard on top. Chicken cooked on the BBQ served with wonderful tasty veg. We had a selection of Dutch cheese and a plum pudding with fennel ice cream.We chatted the night away and we were the last to leave. The kitchen is on view and you can wander into the greenhouse. A huge bowl of apples are there for you to help yourself to on leaving and the chef asked us as we left, what did you enjoy most, the chicken I said and the soup and the cheese, everything I said. Make an effort to visit you won't be disappointed."
225781336,50,"August 31, 2014",Fantastic authentically Dutch restaurant,"De Kas is known as Amsterdams top gourmet restaurant. Make sure to reserve in advance. The space is spectacular. It's a huge glass house in the middle of a beautiful park. They even have their own green house where they grow organic vegetables. The decor is contemporary. There is a lot of light and high ceilings. Just a great ambience. The menu was eclectic and interesting. Hard to fully describe but there was heavy use of fresh vegetables. Delicious. The wine selections were also excellent. Our kids loved the deserts too. All in all, a fantastic find dining experience with the locals."

224695325,50,"August 26, 2014",An Oasis of Dining Elegance Away from the Tourist Area,"We ate at De Kas earlier this month. It was such a welcome relief from the noise and crowds in the city center. My blood pressure went down as soon as we walked in the door. You dine in a greenhouse in the park. Unlike some restaurants in Amsterdam where you are dining on top of others, the tables are nicely spaced. The serivice was impeccable.The menu is fixed price, so if you do not have an adventurous palate, this might not be the place for you. I could have had just the bread and olives and been satisfied. We had a fennel salad, and although I am not a fennel fan, I was eating the leftovers off my son's plate. The soup was a bouillion which was good, but not fabulous. My only issue with the dinner was the main course of mackerel. I thought this was an odd choice, as it is very fishy and not recommended for pregnant women. After one bite, I decided that was enough. The waiter noticed that I didn't like the fish and insisted that I have the meat alternative which was veal. The staff took note that is was my son-in-law's birthday and they brought him a special dessert. Aside from the fish, we had a wonderful experience at De Kas and I highly recommend it. Be aware that it is a bit of a cab ride from the city center - maybe $50 round trip."
224685007,50,"August 26, 2014","Very, very hot","Take over a run down greenhouse. Convert half to grow your own veg and the other half into your own restaurant and you have a super hip combo. Highly recommend this restaurant. It is very slick, a bit off kilter and just great food. Enjoy the experience."
223487729,30,"August 21, 2014",Presentation of food and atmosphere,"Very out of the way for an Amsterdam tourist, approximately $20 euro cab one way fare from city center. Nice setting - restaurant in a greenhouse where they grow their own vegetables. Meal is 3 course fixed which you can expand to include a cheeseboard. The starter and first course were very good, but the main entree was mackerel that was too fishy to eat. Since it was a fixed dinner, we didn't know that we could ask for something else until we had finished the course. Would have been nice if server had shared that info with us ahead of time. Overall, the fresh vegetables were fabulous and the setting very different. I don't think I would return again. Q"
223344599,30,"August 21, 2014","Perfect location, wonderful food, small portions","We choose this restaurant as we read that it is among the most peculiar restaurants in the world. The location is great indeed, and very elegant as well as the waiters. We had the menù with three entrees and one main course. All of them where really good and tasty but very small portions. The price is quite high for what you eat.It is those kind of restaurants that you try once for the experience of eating in a garden."

We started with a glass of house sparkling and wander through the herb garden, followed by the three delicious courses. We all loved it. The flavours were delicately balanced, the portion sizes perfect, and we also opted for the wine matching which also added to the experience. All the staff are friendly and welcoming which isn't always the case in places the calibre of De Kas. Next time I'm booking the chef's table!"

We walked into the park by a side entrance with the greenhouse at a distance. It was absolutely breath taking!The atmosphere was warm and inviting. The service was excellent and the staff goes out of their way to make sure your visit is pleasant. They were very kind and called a taxi for us when it was time to depart.We found the food to be fresh and delicious but it was not outstanding. We had good food and wine but not ""gourmet"" dining.It was a delightful experience nonetheless."

You can see the vegetables and fruits they are serving in their dishes. There is one menu that fits for all, also for vegetarians.

221617821,50,"August 13, 2014",Perfect for a special occasion but you need to be open minded and not a fussy eater!,"My boyfriend recently surprised me with a trip to Amsterdam for my 30th birthday and booked a table for the evening of my birthday to celebrate as he had seen some really good reviews on trip advisor. When we were arrived we were greeted by a lovely lady who was really accommodating and showed us to our table. A waiter then came to explain how De Kas works and the surprise menu and asked if we had any food allergies. Neither myself or my partner have any allergies but my partner told him he didn't like fish and the waiter said no problem. We were given olives, bread and gerkins as an appetiser while we waited for the trio of starters which was great as we were really hungry and nice to nibble on while we waited. 2 out of the 3 starters were delicious but the 3rd was to neither of our tastes but thats more to do with us not liking zucchini. For the main i had fish which was really tasty and not something i would usually pick off a menu. They gave my partner veal which he said was amazing and the vegetables they came with i have to say were the best I've ever tasted! I mentioned to the waiter that it was my birthday and the chef himself bought out my dessert and he had written happy birthday on the plate with chocolate sauce, which was a nice touch. Prices are reasonable considering its somewhere you would go for more of a special occasion. Would definitely recommend for people to try it out, but not for picky eaters. The staff are really friendly and accommodating and I'm sure if you told them you didn't like something they would alter the dish to suite your tastes. Told all my friends and family about it on coming home to the UK and recommended if they go to Amsterdam in the future that they try it."

We got to enjoy a lovely salad, a nicely cooked fish and yummy cake for desert.The beer my partner drank was also locally brewed which made the experience so much more important for the local communityAs soon as we arrived, the staff were so nice and greeted us with great smiles and really took care of us.The decor of the restaurant also added to the experience as we got to enjoy the fantastic sun during the lovely long summers.I would highlight recommend experiencing this restaurant and the great food it provides"

220305612,40,"August 7, 2014",some hits and misses,"i had high hopes for this place, some of which were met, but some were not. The service is very good. The entree was delicious as was the dessert, though the latter was questionably presented.the appetizers were a miss. the soup, which was a creme watercress with pork, was good but i couldn't tell if it was meant to be served hot or just the luke warm that it was. also, it had large chunks of pork in it that made it inelegant to eat without trying to cut it. the two salads were the most disappointing for me. Just random things thrown together that ultimately weren't the better for it. however if there's one piece of advice i can give to the owners it would be to buy new dishes. the ones they have are same that they use in my office cafeteria (all beat up and of industrial quality) and it really takes away overall from the experience. if you're to be serving fine food it should be placed on high quality flat ware. or at least ones that haven't been used for several years and are all scratched up.overall i would still recommend it and the setting and ambiance are quite beautiful. the wine pairing is a good value but the wines themselves are quite unimpressive. the only nice thing is trying wines from areas where you wouldn't normally have them (e.g. The netherlands)."
220031968,40,"August 6, 2014","Great Location and Service, Good Food","The greenhouse is amazing and you are encouraged to walk around and check out what they have growing. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The food is only good. You get very little choice about the menu (the main course for the evening was fish, which I do not eat, so I was offered beef). Dishes were prepared and presented well, but the flavors were a bit bland. The dinner was very expensive, and much more than I would expect for the quality of food. Overall, a nice dinner, but I would not spend that kind of money there again."
219856002,30,"August 5, 2014","past prime, nice location","First, it's a really great space--a greenhouse within a garden, an oasis in urban Amsterdam.That said, De Kas appears to coast on its name--and seems to be past its creative prime. The food is passable; the service is perfunctory and the waitstaff seem to have a script that they mumble as quickly as possible when you are seated. We were seated in a subpar corner table but the waitstaff refused to seat us elsewhere--even though the restaurant was half empty on a Tuesday night. In short, this is an assembly line that seems geared to the out of towner who will likely never visit again.I would caution the visitor to dig deeper and find better food in Amsterdam--certainly the value is low at this venue. I was surprised by our poor experience given other reviews I've read. Too bad!"
219855975,50,"August 5, 2014",Well done,"I came here on business so I can't speak to the price, however, the food was very good. The concept is admirable and attractive - everything you eat is grown on-site or within Amsterdam. The four course meal was well thought out and quite tasty. The desert was probably the best of the four courses which included soup (ok), salad (ok), cheese plate (really good), and filet of sole (pretty good)."

First, the atmosphere is stellar because you are in a greenhouse and it feels like you are in a park. You don't see the city and it feels like a little oasis of peace and countryside. The wait staff was attentive, but not overly so.I thought eating here was an adventure because there isn't a menu. The dishes change daily depending on what is fresh. They grow a number of the fresh veggies and fruits in the green house on premises and have a farm outside of the city. There was a great starter of four different dishes - one featured beets, another spring chicken and root vegetables (amazing!), fresh mozzarella and greens. (Side note: the fresh sourdough baguette with basil oil is awesome!). The main course was sea bass when a delicious mushroom sauce and fresh vegetables. The dessert was a pairfait with giant sweet cherries, vanilla mouse and chocolate/sour cherry sorbet. I would definitely go back and I recommend this if you are looking for something fresh and unique."

My daughter and I went for lunch. We began with the three starter dishes (the roasted eggplant puree was fantastic), proceeded to the main course (a tender and juicy lighter seared piece of haddock), and capped off the meal with the most luscious dessert of fresh berries, vanilla cream, chocolate bits and homemade ice cream. Divine! In fact, I'm still dreaming about that dessert and would return just for that alone!Despite the small portion sizes (main was decent sized), we left satiated and had a very small dinner seven hours later as the meal continued to satisfy.A visit to the greenhouse is a must! Lovely to see all the fresh fruits, herbs and veggies growing on site.Food here is PRICEY. For lunch for two people, including two glasses of wine, one sparkling water, two set menus, two desserts and tip was 132 Euros. Perhaps that's not so expensive for some, but it was certainly an indulgence for us.Bon apetit!"

We sat having a glass of wine before dinner watching the staff carefully choose the garnishments for that evening’s meal. Simply amazing, then the food, WOW. The wine selection is outstanding and the sommelier is extremely knowledgeable. You will need to take a tram if you are staying in the city center, but it is more than worth the trip.

We opted for a lunch as it was a little far from our hotel. There is a set menu and the main that day was fish. As I do not eat fish, they managed to change the main for me with no issues. We ended up having sweetbread, veal tongue and duck breast. Unfortunately, I could not bring myself to eat the sweetbread but the veal tongue and the duck was delicious. The duck breast was cooked to perfection and the flavours were wonderful. For dessert we had some sort of pumpkin cake which I thought might be a bit strange but it was really yummy. The best part about this restaurant was the fact that all the vegetables are grown there in the greenhouse and all of the meat is sourced locally.I highly recommend this restaurant even if you are not that most adventurous foodie."

214153762,50,"July 7, 2014",Good-for-you food that tastes delicious,"My husband brought me to this restaurant as a surprise for my 40th birthday. The first impression was exciting as we walked through the park to get to the restaurant nestled quietly away from the bustling streets in a beautiful setting. The restaurant was bright and clean. We were promptly welcomed and escorted to our table. The service was excellent throughout our dining experience with each server ensuring our bread basket, water, wine, etc. were full. By the way, the bread -- and all the food -- was made on the premises and it was the best bread I ever had. I couldn't stop putting it down even though I really didn't want to fill up on it. I made room for each portion. It was amazing. We loved the restaurant concept of growing many of their own foods. We could tell it made a difference in the quality and taste. I also liked how there are no menus. It's a pre-set meal and all went perfectly.It's also worth noting that we brought our two year old daughter with us and the staff were great with her, too. They brought her over toys to play with. Not just a book with crayons, but actual toys.I'm sure it was expensive, but it was worth it."
214071499,50,"July 7, 2014",A wonderful dining experience in Amsterdam,"This is a worthwhile place to dine in Amsterdam. The ambiance is probably the most attractive part. Definitely an enjoyable place. The food is good, especially for the menu price. Nothing fancy but the portions were appropriate and the taste was great. They easily accommodated my wife's specific dietary needs. The paired wines for the meal were fine, nothing overwhelming but again very appropriate for the price. The restaurant is outside of the centrum but it is a short taxi ride and if you enjoy public transport, it was very easy to get there with the tram. Actually we enjoyed the ride."
213785729,50,"July 5, 2014",Lives up to the hype,The definition of fresh--many of the ingredients are grown on site or produced especially for the restaurant. A tasting menu provides a great diversity of tastes. The excellent service (we had a baby in our party of 8 and they brought her a toy) and an airy setting really highlight the food.
213059755,40,"July 1, 2014","Good quality, fresh food & nice atmosphere","The 5 course menu is a great way to experience this restaurant. The quality is good as all ingredients are fresh. The atmosphere is nice and you can come over to celebrate or just have a nice time. There tend to be quite a lot of groups and business people which I think make it a little less interesting for couples. The size of the portions is quite small and we had been left hungry if we hadn't had the drinks that went with the menu & had the cheese platter. Also on the downside, I don't understand why cooks who use fresh, good quality ingredients don't use spice. I'm sure they'd argue that then you couldn't taste the actual ingredients - but here's the trick to master, in my opinion."

We had the portuguese Wine - service stared well but the staff did not provide new glasses when the second bottle arrived - unusual. Lamb was cooked well, appetizers were nice if not somewhat bland - the atmosphere is gorgeous."
211544574,40,"June 22, 2014","OK, but not for the price","This restaurant is in a beautiful setting, near a park, with its own produce growing outside the windows. They are very proud of the produce (even hand you an apple when you leave), but really, this is not the only restaurant in history to use fresh vegetables or locally-sourced meat. The recitations of the provenance of every little sprig of parsley can seem a bit precious. My least favorite aspect of the restaurant is not being able to have ANY choice of what you're served; you're brought what they feel like serving you. It is a little demoralizing to see a whole room full of diners with the same piece of fish. Food itself was nicely-prepared--but not astonishing. All of our favorite course was the dessert, actually!"

The food was beautifully presented, and this restaurant is a Must for any foodies visiting the area."
210072032,50,"June 12, 2014",Best meal in Amsterdam,"In a city that is very limited in it's culinary offerings, De Kas is a shining beacon. The food is fresh and simply, but imaginatively prepared so that it maintains it's flavour. The atmosphere is also fresh and light. The service is friendly and informative (if a little serious - but I believe that is more a dutch thing than something unique to de Kas). We were in Amsterdam for a week and ate out every night. This was the one restaurant that stood out as being a cut above the rest in terms of overall ambience, cuisine and service. I will be returning to Amsterdam with my family next year and will make sure to visit De Kas at least twice."
209907734,50,"June 11, 2014",A fresh approach to restaurant food,Highly recommended. Suggest you book early. We enjoyed the degustation menu of homegrown seasonal produce used to prepare the meal.
208972329,40,"June 5, 2014",Fresh in the City,"This restaurant tries very hard to source local ingredients. They grow the majority, if not all, of their herbs and vegetables. We were introduced to a Dutch sparkling Riesling from the province of Limburg that was delicious. I didn’t even know that Holland had wineries. The menu is created with the best ingredients available on that day so dinner is always a surprise. They are very good at accommodating food allergies and intolerances. The presentation is meticulous, the chef and his team use classic techniques to maximize the quality of the ingredients. We definitely enjoyed the wine pairing available with our dinner. This is a slow dinner, not to be rushed. The staff is young, ambitious and talented. Granted, this restaurant is not for everyone. But, if you love real food and recognize the value of quality, then it is a must."
208746855,20,"June 3, 2014",left hungry and disappointed,"What made the meal was the company of my 6 best friends and the setting of the gardens and greenhouse. I wasnt going to spoil our special night but felt I should review the place honestly. De kas takes itself very serious and airs on the side of pretension. As soon as our bottoms hit the chair and before we' d been shown any menu or winelist we were offered a appetizer of sparkling wine at 10 euros a glass. Then a very quick confusing explaination of our 3 starters which were ok but not sure why there were 3 and what the connection was between them. then a very rude waitress offered us more wine when our glasses were all full, when we declined she said ""really?"" Main course tiny, 1 new potato half a purple carrot....and pork medallion! Not very special. Then strawberry soup blob of sorbet, speck of yogurt and a few basil leaves. Again it was just ok. So overall TOTALLY OVERPRICED. We found a great little bar in amsterdam with homemade food, great portions, fab wine and beer and lovely staff for a quarter of the price! So think before you book, an occasion is what you make it not what you pay for it!"
208716090,40,"June 3, 2014",unique!,"i had made a reservation for de kas after reading some nice reviews and decided it will be nice for a birthday dinner when we are back in Amsterdam!The place was not so easy to find but that was understandable! I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the whole layout of the place and the greenhouse effect of the restaurant.On top of that, staff were extremely nice, knowledgable about the food as well as wine pairing and were enthusiastic about explaining the dishes and ingredients used etc.. it was indeed a nice plus point! They also spoke excellent english by the way! :)All in, we had an enjoyable meal and was happy! Did well in making reservations ahead of time and also finding out how to get to the place. Oh, tip : u could also ask to sit near the kitchen where you can get up close and personal with the chef i think! :)"

Many thanks to Tony, William (the happiest guy you'll ever meet) and the team for making the night so special for us."
208261767,50,"May 31, 2014",Excedes all Expectations!!,"A short but pleasant tram ride from the city centre. This is one of the best meals I have had in any restaurant each course was a gastronomic delight! The chefs use there own home grown vegetables and fruit whenever possible and if not available local source produce.The waiter was very knowledgeable about each course and the wine. They aim to please. Atmosphere was excellent especially when it got dark outside the interior glass lights are stunning.I cannot wait to go back to Amsterdam to visit De Kas, be sure to make reservations ahead of time at least a week."

207826082,40,"May 29, 2014",Glasshouse gastronomy,"De Kas may be a little way out of the centre of Amsterdam but it is certainly worth a visit. It's unique glasshouse style is complemented by unhurried top quality service and organic food from its fixed menu which does have a bit of flexibility for substitution when components of the dishes do not suit individual diners. They know what you should want, right down to the water which they deliberately serve at room temperature as that is better for you than if it was served chilled. It was our most expensive dinner in four days in Amsterdam, and not quite the best, so value lets it down."
207659337,50,"May 28, 2014",Lives up to the reputation,"People who say the food in Amsterdam isn't up to par haven't been to DeKas. The spectacular setting in a converted greenhouse is a little off the beaten track, but is well worth the trip. And there's something extra special about walking past the garden to your seat, and seeing where a good part of your dinner grows. Menu is prix fixe, and covers all the bases. Most everything comes with some kind of edible flower, and is beautifully presented. Great for a special night out."
207476398,50,"May 28, 2014",Mediterranean vegetables from own greenhouses+garden,"With several friends we had a fantastic dinner at the the exclusive chef's table in the kitchen of the Kas, where dinner is at the mercy of the kitchen brigade. Since all of us are vegetarians we let the chef surprise us and he and his crew put heart and soul in out of the ordinary food.How great it is that there are chef's willing to use their artistic mind and not come up with a regular pasta."

207150040,50,"May 26, 2014",Must visit if in Amsterdam,"We visited Amsterdam in February 2014 and De Kas was recommended by a good friend who lived out in Amsterdam. I called a week before and could not get a table but was put on the waiting list. Low and behold on out day of travel to Amsterdam I got a call to say we could be fitted in for lunch. We accepted! It is about a 15 minute taxi drive from the centre of town. The De Kas concept is fab - they only serve local produce available - either grown in their conservatory or sourced locally in holland. The menu therefore is variable and you chose either 2 or 3 courses with dietary requirements taken into account. Fantastic spacious room, gorgeous food and great customer service - can't go wrong! If you are visiting Amsterdam, book before hand and enjoy!"
207015919,30,"May 25, 2014",Well... I didn't like it,"Beautiful restaurant, but I didn't like the food. You don't get to choose what you eat, so if you don't like what's for dinner, too bad. I had lamb for main couse, which I don't particularly care for. The desert was a lemony thing, too acid for a good desert."
206611111,50,"May 22, 2014",Lost for words,"A very late review for one of the best restaurants I've visited. Like another contributor I simply didn't know how to describe the visit adequately...We've eaten at De Kas a number of times over the years, enjoying the dedication to seasonal menus, their garden, and the greenhouse which all are encouraged to wander through. The service is effortless: thoughtful but unobtrusive, and occasionally astounding. After an exceptional birthday meal in 2012 I jokingly requested 'the same meal next year'. The chef nodded, a note was made, and twelve months later - for our table only - 'my meal' was produced with, of course, De Kas variations. All done with the minimum of fuss but with obvious pleasure at my reaction. Thank you so much everyone. Tot ziens!"

205886813,50,"May 17, 2014",Delightful in Spring,"Slightly dubious normally about seasonal set menus, especially for children, but this was a really lovely experience. Middle of a peaceful park outside the town centre, with modern European style food, and an emphasis on fresh vegetables and fruit. Sitting in a glasshouse on longer bright evenings is a great, relaxing time. Very good service. I'd recommend the reasonably priced wine pairings ( especially as you don't know what you're going to eat!)"

205069588,50,"May 11, 2014",Fabulous vegetables!!,"I am a vegan and they catered to my lifestyle. I really enjoyed all the dishes. I had the two course lunch followed by a dessert. They bring bread, olive oil, olives, and cauliflower before you place an order. I love that all the ingredients are either grown by them or are bought from quality organic farms. I would reccomend this place to anyone. The food was delcious and the greenhouse you sit in is amazing. So in love with this little gem of a find. Must make a reservation by email though!"
204952818,50,"May 10, 2014",Words won't do it justice,"I have been putting off doing a review of De Kas, simply for one reason. I don't think I have the words or vocabulary to do this experience justice.My daughter and I started planning a trip to Europe in the late fall for spring. My one piece of the trip was dinner at De Kas. I had wanted to eat here for years and wanted to make sure I did on this trip. The food gods were smiling down on me when I e-mailed them and was able to snag the chef's table for one of the nights we were in Amsterdam. I couldn't wait. I read everything I could and was counting the days!As luck would have it, two weeks prior to our trip my daughter could no longer make the trip with me. Because of so many non-refundable deposits I decided to make the trip alone. My one concern was - how weird would it be to have the chef's table at De Kas alone? Would I feel strange? I really debated about going and finally wrote the restaurant and asked if I should now just dine in the dining room, cancel or keep my chef's table reservation. They replied back to keep my chef's table reservation. It would be fine. I was so happy they encouraged me to stay as I wouldn't have wanted to miss this experience for anything.I took the tram to Frankendael Park and walked through the park (lovely way to arrive). Suddenly a greenhouse appeared over the quaint footbridge. The first thing I noticed walking in was children playing in the greenhouse with fresh produce growing. It was a perfect arrival.The host greeted me and quickly introduced me to Chef Bas Wiegel who showed me to a wonderful table off to the side of the kitchen. I sat down and from the moment the magic started. I also never once felt weird of strange dining alone - suddenly I had a whole kitchen and restaurant full of new friends.Lets start there - with the staff. Did each person make me feel welcome? Yes, I felt like I was no longer in a restaurant but in a friend's home. I felt like I was a dinner guest and not a restaurant customer. The chefs all stopped by at some point and talked ""food"" with me. The wine stewardess was simply amazing and not only charmed me but taught me all about new Dutch wines. My new passion - I am now back home and obsessed at going into wine shops in the area on the quest for finding Dutch wines. (The Dutch wine industry needs to use her as a spokesperson as she sold me on the product!) The entire staff was amazing, friendly, hip, cool, fun, professional, knowledgeable - keep pulling adjectives out of your hat because all the superlatives would fit the crew at De Kas.Then the food started to arrive. I have a food gauge that I compare all meals to on the food scale. That scale is the French Laundry in Napa Valley. We use to have a weekend home not far from The French Laundry and on a few special occasion we would eat there - from there I had a nucleolus in which to compare all restaurant meals and gauge who would come closest to the French Laundry bulls eye. Well my bulls eye changed on April 18th, my new food gauge is De Kas.Because of their own greenhouse and farm things are fresh. Bas Wigel works his menu from what is going on in the ground and in the fields. Most things are local or from the area or what was in season. For example my fish was from Norway, not local, but from a purveyor they use and who is familiar with fresh and in season. However all the vegetables were from the immediate area.Each plate was a work of art, decorated with edible flowers. My two favorite courses were the scallops adorned with a squash blossom and the fresh spargal (white asparagus) that was at the peak of freshness in Holland. However each bite was a bit of heaven. Wines came with each course and as I mentioned prior I was falling in love with the Dutch wines, especially the whites which were as good as any German white wine which are more famous.These are fellow foodies. So with each course we talked where the food came from, how it was prepared and discussed why the wine works with this course.Another observation I made was that this is a sane kitchen. I have worked in kitchens, I have sat at other chef's tables and I can tell you a lot of kitchens are NOT calm places. There is yelling, swearing, plates slamming and even a fight or two! This was calm, the crew worked well together and seemed to take the whole process serious. There was no yelling, screaming or swearing. Just calm and the love of the craft.After the courses, I was given a grand tour of the greenhouse and gardens. I saw what was coming up and what was next in season. Being a part of co-op farm in Pennsylvania I found this part of the meal very interesting. The tour ends in the restaurant with dessert and coffee and of course an after dinner wine!When I left I stopped the garden who was enjoying an after work beer to thank them. This was indeed a evening magic with great wines, amazing food, gardens and amazing people. I came in alone, but I left with a group of new friends who I respect and admire for what they do each and every night at De Kas."

Its not over-the-top beautiful the way some finer michelin-starred restaurants are, but still breathtaking. The food was of a high calibre and very well executed and presented. It did all taste quite ""healthy"", too. Which did make it seem less of an indulgence. On the whole though, a great experience."

All produce is grown by them and the setting is a huge, high ceiling greenhouse. I was someone's guest and made the best of it,but it would not be my choice to eat here. The salad was delicious with unusual greens and veggies and very good. I asked for my sliced duck to be served well done, but it wasnm't as well done as I'd have liked. Portions were very small.

Set inside the boundaries of Frankendael Park, the glass conservatory makes for a wonderful dining experience. I enjoyed our food and friends so much that, once again, I forgot to take photos.

The service was great and the food was generally excellent. But, you should assume you're eating at friend's house and not a restaurant and just take what you get. For example, I asked for Prosecco, but the only option was a sparkling Dutch wine (fine). Similar situation with beer. You get the beer they serve. At the end of the meal I was asked if I wanted an after dinner drink and yup - I just got one - no choices at all for anything. Having said that, most of the meal was really excellent. We had lamb as the main course. The dessert was a lemon cream, crumbled macaroon, farm cheese ice cream concoction that neither I nor my sister ate, but which our male companions ate after consuming theirs so guess some people find that combination appealing."

Of course advance reservations are essential.De Kas serves a more or less preset meal allowing for a couple of possible variations. The presentations were first rate although the food was ""real"" (rather than ""cute"") and the portions were adequately sized -- no one left hungry. The staff gladly and graciously accommodated my gluten-free wife (she said they served the best gluten free bread ever) and made other menu variations to meet everyone's dietary needs.

A low-key, soft spoken guy who explained a little about the kitchen and the concept before the food started arriving.I won't go through all the courses, but I do want to mention that all courses was presented by the chef that prepared the dish. The main course was actually completed at the table, and it was the best lamb I have ever had.After the main course Bas gave us a tour of the greenhouse and restaurant before the cheese and dessert. It was nice to get up and move a little bit before the last delicious bites.In short it was a perfect evening with delicious food, friendly and attentive staff and a wonderful setting.I can only recommend visiting Bas and his staff in the kitchen of De Kas."

201079664,50,"April 14, 2014","Sky bright, skylight, meat-eaters and vegetarians' delight!","I had booked a couple of restaurants for our trip to Amsterdam which I thought would appeal to the family and especially to my vegetarian wife. I had thought that the other one, the Blue Pepper, an Indonesian restaurant, would be ahead in that category, but it turned out to be De Kas instead (though BP was still an enjoyable experience). The concept involves the restaurant growing some its own produce on the premises and sourcing locally, so it takes its fruit and veg very seriously! More to the point, it turns out interesting and tasty dishes, which is a good thing given its no choice approach.For the 3 of us who are not vegetarians, we each received a sharing platter of a portion each of a vegetarian dish (Dutch mozzerella anyone?), fish (mackerel) and meat (duck), all tastily garnished. We enjoyed our delicious main of lamb as much as my wife enjoyed hers of beetroot and fennel. We all shared a single portion of the cheese platter before wolfing down our puddings. A first taste for me of delicious Dutch sparkling riesling set up the whole meal nicely, which charming slick service only enhanced.It's slightly off the beaten track, being in a glasshouse (which is its name in Dutch) in a park, but easily accessible by taxi or tram (the number 9, which stopped at the same point as the taxi rank).Recommended."
200980393,30,"April 13, 2014",A meal of two halves,"Lovely staff, fantastic setting but odd. You go there on the 9 tram ( stops right outside - Hogewege) & pay €49 for a set meal - no choice - you get what arrives. Starters well done in themselves but disastrous together - lovely mackerel with really bitter leaves which didn't work at all, mozzarella & turnip (?), beautiful duck great in itself but with marinaded cold carrot?But fantastic lamb as a main course. Cheese didn't impress.Lovely setting & the staff are marvellous. You should go to experience it but just go with it & be prepared if some things don't work."
200960751,50,"April 13, 2014","Excellent, once again!!","I've been to De Kas a few times and each time was fantastic! The comfortable & casual dining room is located within an operational greenhouse in a beautiful park. The service is outstanding, the food tasty, fresh and innovative. This is a special place!"
200304299,50,"April 8, 2014",What a wonderful and unique restaurant,My wife and I spent 4 days in Amsterdam and went to De Kas for lunch on our final day.The food is top class and the setting is so different to the normal fare in Amsterdam it made for a perfect finish to our stay.It is away from the Old Town but take tram 9 to Hogeweg and there it is!
200004280,40,"April 5, 2014",Local food,"You eat in an old greenhouse and you see the vegetables grow around the corner. We had a 2 course surprise lunch and it was all good. Fresh, local vegetables and especially the fish dishes was suberb. Special plus to interesting and good wine pairing!"
200000827,50,"April 5, 2014",Should be in the top 5 in Amsterdam,"Wonderful concept... beautiful, fresh seasonal ingredients either grown in the greenhouse/gardens or sourced locally. Light preparation with delicious sauces and dressings. Excellent wine paring. Environment is unique (a greenhouse) - it is light, airy and stylish... delightful place. Excellent service as well.... It is a bit out of the way so suspect that is why it is not so highly rated but this place deserves to be in the top 5 or 10 in the city. it is always full and filled mainly with locals."
199383706,50,"March 31, 2014",Perfection,We went to De Kas for lunch and were thrilled with the food and with the service. It was outstanding. It is outside of downtown Amsterdam but well worth the taxi or the tram to get there. Each course was perfect. Great presentation and truly delicious.
199058092,40,"March 28, 2014",Excellent food in interesting surroundings,"This restaurant serves creative dishes, with the overall experience being enhanced by its situation in a large greenhouse or conservatory. It is located somewhat off-centre, requiring either an energetic walk, a taxi or public transport for the typical tourist, but it is definitely worth the effort.On a Tuesday evening, with the establishment well-frequented seemingly largely by locals, we were offered a set menu consisting of three starters to be shared between the two of us (dishes of grey mullet, veal and leeks/buffalo mozzarella/hazelnuts) and a main course of haddock with a number of finely judged accompaniments, principally a cannelloni stuffed with jerusalem artichoke. The final course was either dessert (didn't have and so cannot comment, except that the people on the next table seemed to be enjoying theirs) or delightful local cheeses served with fine accompaniments. All the dishes suggested creativity and a delicacy of flavouring and preparation; particularly notable was the finesse with which a fairly ordinary fish like haddock became so memorable.The service was friendly and attentive, and the whole experience was one of the highlights of our stay in Amsterdam. Needless to say, this did come at a cost, but the overall experience was well worthwhile."
198036128,20,"March 20, 2014",Over estimated !,Dissapointed and overpriced for a restaurant that suppose to be good .1) starter came with hair in the plate .2) main dish ( lamp with some vegetables ) cold and hard to chew .3) After my main dish i asked for a coffee which came 40 minutes later ( 10 minutes before we leave .)4) the waiter had no experience on opening a bottle of wine ( price range of our order over average ) .Really hope for them to get better since the concept of the restaurant is really nice .
197808444,40,"March 18, 2014","Interesting food, cool location!","I really enjoyed eating here. We were very lucky with the weather and although it had been a pretty awful day, as we arrived the sun came out and it made our time sitting in the lovely big greenhouse very pleasant.The food is interesting and inventive, with very nice presentation and new and interesting tastes and textures being incorporated well.I love that all the produce is local and the staff are all very friendly and knowledgable.I really enjoyed eating here, and I would recommend it as it's in a nice, less visited part of the city and the whole experience was really very good."
197749170,40,"March 17, 2014",Amazing food!,"We dined at De Kas last Saturday the 15th March. Firstly the food was fantastic! We went for the all in package which included 6 courses with matching wines for €100 per person. We felt this was great value. I had perviously informed the restaurant that it was a special occasion, my husbands 40th. I was delighted when they said happy birthday to him on arrival, gave us a good table and also special birthday dessert. The venue is epic, however, if I'm been picky, is not very well lit inside. It's a too bright and, given the amazing space, should have more ambience. The building is beautifully lit from the outside, it's a shame this does not carry though. Our only real criticism is service. All the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable but at times a bit too over familiar and chatty. We also had a least 5 different staff wait on us, far to many, so there was no continuity. After the fish course the service really slowed down, we waited far to long between courses. The evening started out very smoothly, and we were made to feel welcome, however as the restaurant became busy the standard slipped. I would visit the restaurant again and would recommend it. If these minor issues could be rectified then it would be a perfect dining experience."
197313667,40,"March 13, 2014",Nice experience,"We went there for my birthday last year. Amazing service, tasty food made out of fresh and quality ingredients. It is quite expensive(50€ only for the meal), but nice for a special treat!"
195174993,40,"February 24, 2014",Delicious Food in Amsterdam,"One of the most incredibly delicious foods in Amsterdam. I keep coming back every time I am in town. Though this is the first time I am writing a review about the Kas. The first time, we were looking for a place to grab a quick lunch and the Kas was a sheer delight. We were so glad to have found this quaint restaurant tucked in at a corner of the city. The food was great and the waitress who attended us had been overtly pleasant. She always had a welcoming smile on her face. The prices, we found were slightly on the higher side, though the meal was filling and sufficient. I quite understand the slightly higher price range, because it comes within the Tourist Zone. Good ambience and easy to reach. Not too many customers were present at that time of the night, yet the service was a bit slow. We had to wait for a while for the food to arrive."
194986485,40,"February 22, 2014",Worth a visit,"The venue and the setting is worth the visit, it's about 15 min by car from the center of Amsterdam, it was also exciting to see the greenhouses where the produce is grown, but unfortunately overall the food did not meet my expectations, having all that vegetables grown in house, the main dishes were lacking flavor, the soup and the desserts were fine and the wine recommendations were excellent, the service was also attentive and friendly."
194475568,50,"February 17, 2014",Exquisite vegetables,"It takes a bit of patience to get a table on a week-end, but it is worth trying. Kas means green house - and most of their vegetables are actually coming from their own production. Incredibly tasting, and would recommend the house menu (4 dishes including Dutch cheeses). Desert was a bit too original for some of my colleagues, but overall a great experience. I will (try to) return."
194166493,50,"February 15, 2014",Another Great Gluten Free Meal,"My husband and I booked our reservation at De Kas for Valentine's Day. We had visited this restaurant during our last trip to Amsterdam and found it charming with great ""foodie"" food and an enthusiastic and attentive staff. It did not disappoint on our second visit. While I was a bit worried that the pressure of Valentine's Day might cause a slight dip in food quality or service, the kitchen and wait staff did not let us down.First, for all the gluten-free folks - this restaurant understands our needs. All of my dishes were prepared glulten-free, but I did not feel slighted in the least. Instead, the differences in the way my dishes were prepared were slight and I believe might have been even better than my husband's dishes who is not gluten-free. Our waitress, Rachel, even brought me a separate container or oil for my gluten-free bread so that my husbands wheat bread would not contaminate mine.The meal was beautiful, interesting and extremely well paced. They listened to our likes and dislikes and made adjustments to their normal three-course, fixed-price meal. We had the wine parings which were quite good and fell within what we would have paid for a bottle of wine. They did not skimp on the pouring and came back more than once to give us a bit more so that we did not have an empty glass.Finally, when we were leaving, the staff gave my husband a bag of cookies baked in the shape of hearts in honor of the day. However, the hostess remembered that I was gluten-free and asked us to wait for just a moment as she returned to the kitchen to bring me some caramels as a special gift.You would need to go a long way to find a more congenial and delicious restaurant - especially for the gluten-free!"
193146614,50,"February 5, 2014",What a nice kas this is,"This is our second visit to the kas. Clearly it means we had a good memory of the first time, but this time was even better.We arrive at night in a beautiful day that made the settings absolutely splendid. The illuminated greenhouse, the stars in the sky, the moon, fantastic start.There is no menu here you eat a set dinner that springs nicely and at an appropriate pace at your table.From the Amuse bouche to the starters to the main to the cheese, the desert and the fantastic wine recommended by the waitress everything was very very nice.The service impeccable all the way through.And at a very affordable price for the quality of the fresh produce we received.The only slight downside, the place seems to be much more popular than one year ago when we discovered it. It was crowded with large groups especially 2 large American table behind us that were very very noisy.Would I recommend this? AbsolutelyWould I come back? See you next time I'm in Amsterdam"
192788130,40,"February 1, 2014",Perfect dinner,"I went with a couple of friends on my last night in Amsterdam. The service wasn't the greatest - I had made a reservation for 3 and they had 6 in their book. For some reason, we were made to sit at the bar for about half an hour or more while they got our seating arranged. It wasn't that busy.When it got to actually eating, however, the food was delicious. One of the most memorable meals I've had. Will definitely go back when I'm in Amsterdam again and will definitely recommend to friends."
192692461,50,"January 31, 2014",A perfect birthday meal,"De Kas is wonderful!The food is incredible, the surroundings are perfect, the staff are very knowledgable and make you feel perfectly at home (some places of De Kas' standard can be quite snobby).We went for the wine matching which was brilliant. Can't fault anything really other than I wish it was in Manchester!"
192337284,50,"January 28, 2014",Delish,Just became a member of TA and I have to write a review of this awesome place. I loved the fact they grow their own veggies. You can walk and see it yourself in the attached greenhouse. The food was light and tasty. Friendly service. When I go to Amsterdam I will definitely come back!
192079430,50,"January 26, 2014","Pure, honest, delicious!",Local ingredients only. Based on the time of the year. They grow their own veggies. Meat and fish are from nearby eco suppliers. Love. That's what you taste!
192025851,50,"January 25, 2014",one word : excellent !,"I have been here several times now,and every time it is a great experience.Great service, the food is excellent,a seasonable set menu, most vegetables come from the greenhousein which the restaurant is basically located.For an exceptional experience try the Chef's Table, in the kitchen.With every course another well suitable wine is served.Also a great place for a (food) party."
191634766,50,"January 21, 2014","Great atmosphere, excellent food","We reserved for 7 people and arrived an hour in advance. We were seated immediately. Really great location and atmosphere, friendly and professional staff, excellent food and wine. 3 course set menu and wine selections were definitely a success!!! We expected (and were ready) to pay more for the unique experience and great food but finally, the price was very reasonable. Thanks yo the chef and all the staff. Definitely recommending."
190520736,50,"January 11, 2014",A memorable highlight,"We sat at the kitchen table, and over several hours enjoyed a variety of exciting food with expertly matched wines, including some we had not previously encountered. The explanations by the chefs and maitre d' were informative without being intrusive; the knowledge of food and wine displayed by all was a joy and an education.Locally sourced vegetables drive the menus, which are notably low carb, with wonderful fish and meat combinations. This is refreshing approach would appeal to both vegetarians and carnivores equally. It is impossible to single out any one particular dish, but only to say that we eat every single morsel.The kitchen table is more expensive, but worth every penny for anyone with an interest in how food is prepared, menus chosen, orders taken and distributed and, of course, how the wine is chosen. There was not a hint of Gordon Ramseyesque behaviour, just calm efficiency all around.This memorable evening was the food highlight of a delightful 5 day trip to Amsterdam. We look forward to our next visit."
190504314,50,"January 11, 2014",One of the best eating experiences in Amsterdam,I really enjoyed my meal here. The setting is lovely (in a greenhouse surrounded by fresh fruit and vegetables). The food is well cooked and feels healthy. Highly recommended!!
188381568,50,"December 23, 2013",Excellent resteraunt and building,"Came here in December for lunch as we couldn't get a last minute dinner reservation. The food was beautiful, it was a two course set menu lunch. The dishes are not listed rather come out as a surprise. The actual building is fantastic very pretty, we'll renovated and cool. Staff are also wonderful. Would Highly recommend and book in advance."
188282912,50,"December 22, 2013","Excellent atmosphere, food and service.",Had a delicious meal here at the weekend. It was incredible. All the food was so fresh and served with a smile. We had been recommended it by a friend and it was definitely worth a visit!
187784696,50,"December 16, 2013",It's about time...,"It has been years since I go to The Kas and -shame on me- I have never written a review…Every time I'm in Amsterdam I try to visit them. As it is never planned, I usually phone the day before hoping (…) they have a table free. I must say I am always lucky, because every time I went, the place was fully booked and they always manage to give me a table.What I love about The Netherlands is their laid-back attitude. I mean, this is a top restaurant, but they are all SO genuinely kind! Not stuffy at all, which is quite refreshing. Some of the staff that recognizes me just come to the table to say hi. They really make you feel special.As for the food: it is a fixed menu. One can choose from vegetarian, fish or meat. The nibbles and bread are delicious! The starter is for sharing: 3 little plates of absolutely the most vibrant colors and delightful tastes! One forgets how a real tomato tastes like…The main course is from the same range: beautiful, tasty and so fresh.Desserts are sometimes so beautifully presented it's almost a shame to put your spoon in it…They also have a small, but perfect wine list. Uncommon wines as well as the usual suspects.Herbal teas are as you would expect, of an excellent quality.As for the check: no need to take a mortgage on your house: it is very reasonably priced for the quality they serve.Overall, it's not only one of the best restaurants on my list, but definitely my favorite: excellent food and drinks, amazing staff combined in a unique place!Thank you all at The Kas for making each experience unique and memorable!"
187602286,50,"December 14, 2013",Unique Setting and Excellent Cuisine,3 course set price meal with perfect wine pairings. We had venison with lingonberries and smoked mashed potatoes as a main. The staff were exceptionally nice and attentive.
187043215,50,"December 7, 2013",Cool spot,"I visited this restaurant during my trip to Amsterdam and I must say it was one of the coolest spots I have ever been. The food had an idea and tasted great. The service was very good and knowledgeable. I loved the open space and attached greenhouse, through which you can walk and check on their vegetables. even though it is a little far from the center it is really worth the trip."
186012917,50,"November 26, 2013",An Remarkable Experience,"If you can only reserve one restaurant in Amsterdam, make it this one. De Kas, situated in an revamped nursery, was a destination to see as well as taste. We were hesitant to take public transportation so far out of town...super clean and fun. We were nervous about the single choice for dinner...delectable. The waiters were fun and the hostess came by several times to make sure everything was perfect. Our food was fresh, hot, (or cold) and tasty. The atmosphere was bright, clean, and sparkly. Coming from California, fresh, local food is expected. Don't forget to take an apple at the door on your way out...it was the perfect ending."
186011235,50,"November 26, 2013",Fantastic night out ... so tasty!,"My wife and I were in Amsterdam for 4 nights, and a friend recommended this place - its found in an old greenhouse that has been converted to a restaurant. It was lovely.We took the tram there, but on our walk in, we couldn't help but be impressed by the modern feel of the place. You pass the ""garden"" as you walk in (alas in November there wasn't much growing, but they later told us its usually full!)The front of house staff were really nice and warmly welcomed us, taking our jackets and then walking us through the main ""atrium"" to our table. It was very nice looking.We had the prix fixe menu which included several plates (four in total I believe, including cheese/dessert), and the accompanying wine tasters. The food was delicious! So fresh and local (the staff explained everything comes from their local greenhouse when able).The price was high, but we both agreed it was reflected in the quality and portions of the various plates.All in all, highly recommended!"
186003635,40,"November 26, 2013",Great service nice food,I've been here with a couple of business partners tonight and I must say we were pleasantly surprised with the great service. I rarely see such attention towards the dining customers. Most restaurants you really have to initiate contact with the serving personnel but here they were ahead of us each time.Food was nice and all organic made in their own greenhouse. It was nice but not mind blowing. I will go here again with my wife just because she loves biological food.
185527491,50,"November 22, 2013",An absolute stunner,"The service was fantastic, warm, engaging and VERY knowledgable. I loved having no menus, and just accepting the wonderful surprises served.

185439699,20,"November 21, 2013","Poor service, cold food and disinterested staff",Title says it all. Great setting but praise stops there. Took ages to get served.

185431837,50,"November 21, 2013",Beautiful setting,"The setting and being able to eat in the greenhouse where most of the produce comes from is really a great concept. The service is fantastic, wonderful wine pairing, and the meal itself was very good. Definatly worth a try."
185225390,50,"November 19, 2013",English Couple - We highly recommend a visit!,"I wanted to make sure the weekend trip I organised was extra special for my Boyfriend's 30th Birthday. After weeks of researching, I came across De Kas on a number of websites. It came highly recommended and even ranked as one of the 'top 5 restaurants in Amsterdam'. Early booking was advised, so after emailing them directly with my reservation enquiry, I was pleased to hear from them confirming availability for Dinner. I explained it was for a birthday and was looking to arrange something special, they reassured me that this would be noted and a nice romantic table be set up for us. No advance deposit was required, just a request to email them the day before to confirm.Only a short tram ride, away from all the busy tourist areas was just perfect for us!! From the outside it's looks like a lovely old brick building with a very large fancy conservatory/green house on the side of it. Inside it's beautifully decorated, atmosphere is warm & welcoming not overly noisy nor cramped. The staff are so accommodating, they explain the menu thoroughly, consisting of 3 starters (to share) a main course each & then a dessert each all for approx 50 euros. The waiter staff also recommend the wine pairing to accompany the meal, and I would highly recommend you do this and at only approx 25 euro you get around 4 glasses each. We loved the fact that you didn't feel rushed in between courses and the food.....well....it was just fantastic! When the dessert arrived the Chef had decorated my boyfriends plate very sophisticatedly with ""Happy 30th Birthday"". What an enjoyable memorable birthday he had.Thank you De Kas.(P.s - it's certainly not the cheapest place, but you definitely get what you pay for!)"
185038630,50,"November 17, 2013",Beautiful setting,"The restaurant is set in the park and even walking into it is a lovely experience. We went in the evening and it was quite magical to see, the setting is beautiful. The service is very good everyone was attentive but not overbearing. The food is taken from their own gardens and if they don't have it they source it locally. The meal was very interesting with a variety of vegetables not usually found, such as purple potatoes and yellow carrots, very tasty ( I particularly enjoyed the beetroot ). I think it is slightly overpriced compared to some other meals I have had in Amsterdam, but the setting is unique, so I suppose that is what you are paying for. But it is worth a visit, especially for a special occasion."
184848062,50,"November 15, 2013",Sitting in the kitchen - a real experience,"I was lucky enough to eat at the Chef's table last week and thoroughly enjoyed the evening. After meeting Tommy, the head Chef, each Chef came to the table, introduced themselves and then explained what they had prepared for us. We had multiple small courses - each also accompanied by a selection of wines (each poured and described in detail).The food is grown in their own gardens and greenhouses and the chef takes what he has fresh and then decides what to put with it (fish, fowl etc). We enjoyed and very nice clear mushroom soup (served to the table in transparent tea pots), fresh salmon smoked on the premises, very slow roasted meats and, with them all, a selection of uncommon vegetables (the purple potatoes stand out in my mind).Between the main meal and dessert we had a tour around the restaurant and then enjoyed a selection of cheeses (one of which, a buffalo cheese, was made by the waitress's parents) and finally a very nice poached pear accompanied by ice-cream.I should mention the washer-up - he was a star and very entertaining. Also Martin - lovely guy."
184678711,50,"November 14, 2013",An experience not to be missed in Amsterdam,"Easily one of the best places I've been to. The setting is so unique and charming, they could have served card board and I would have loved it. :)But the food is also great.I love their menu: they have a ""lunch"" or ""dinner"" item. That's it. It's fresh in-season ingredients, mostly from their own garden, made into a dish created by the chef for that day. The food couldn't be more perfect.The restaurant is set on a the grounds of a park inside a green house. Great light in the dining room (it's all glass!), and great decor. Very nicely done.Their approach to service is also pleasantly relaxed (very un-American!); not inattentive, just relaxed. They were running around, but didn't make us feel like things were rushed. We sat there for 1.5 hours for lunch. They spaced out drinks, appetizers, and entrees so perfectly that it didn't really feel like 1.5 hours. I would generally be annoyed if my lunch took that long, but they made it feel right. And they were in no rush to get us out; we could have easily sat there for another half hour without anyone bothering us.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner in Amsterdam. It's a little pricey, but well worth the money."

The ambience is so serene, uplifting and warm. The daylight floods into the restaurant that is situated in a greenhouse, with a little pond, all you see is green. The food was delicious. We ventured in De Kas with two kids for lunch (with reservation of course) kind of concerned that the kids may not like the food. But it was really very good, the starters as well as the main dish. The check was also very reasonable. Overall we walked out fully satisfied. They even sent us off with organic apples as gifts."

The resturant is a 100 plus feet set back from the street so at night you feel very removed from the neighborhood. The greenhouse glass ceiling and lighting are warming. Food is seasonal and exceptionally fresh. Once you state items you won't eat such as pork or nuts, your choices are done. Each course was exceptional and flavors were well tuned to each other.The servers work well as a team and the tables are spaced for maximum comfort. Would absolutely will go back."
182078359,40,"October 23, 2013","Good food, nice ambiance, but expensive","There are two things special about this place, ""De Kas"", which means ""The Greenhouse"" in Dutch:1. It is in a greenhouse, where in certain parts (all kinds of) vegetables are still grown. This gives a very specific and nice ambiance2. Almost all food is grown by themselves, or by local sustainable and organic producersThe preparation of the food and the wines are of a high quality, and the service is fine and very very friendly as well.Only drawback is the price, 100 euro a person is easily spent for a diner."
181732966,50,"October 20, 2013",An amazing meal in an amazing space,"De Kas is a very special restaurant. It is set inside a massive greenhouse that once grew vegetables for the town. Part of the space is still used fro growing and you can walk through this fragrant garden. The greenhouse itself is set in a beautiful park. It is a truly magical setting. If you arrive before sunset you should stroll through the park first and then once you are seated in the restaurant watch the sky change from blue to pink to violet through the glass walls and ceiling. Once the sun has set the glass walls reflect the glow of candles on the tables, making it very romantic, There is an open kitchen so you can see the creative chefs at work. There is always a tasting menu using local produce from their own farm and green house and carefully sourced ingredients. The night we dined there it was a special vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings for each course available. The cooking was creative, delicate and unique. De Kas is a bit of a splurge but well worth it to experience this lovely space and fine cuisine."
181385232,30,"October 17, 2013",Everything but the food had the wow factor,"I chose this restaurant to be the star of our short trip to Amsterdam. Given that my wife is a vegetarian I wanted her to have food that was thoughtfully prepared and cooked specifically for vegetarians. All the reviews and guide books indicated that this was a restaurant for 'foodies' and we were both looking forward to it. We caught the No. 9 tram which dropped you right outside the park, had a drink in the bar over the road because we were early and made our way to the restaurant. It is a stunning restaurant, very stylish and you immediately feel at home. The staff are young, attentive, very enthusiastic, very knowledgable and you could not wish for better service. We had wines as recommended for the courses which were terrific value and very good. Somehow and my wife said it first that the only thing we did not rave about was the food. It was well cooked and there was nothing wrong, but that was the point, neither did it have the wow factor either in taste or presentation. Given that this is not a cheap restaurant we somehow just expected more and were willing for there to be a course that we could rave about. It didn't happen which is a real shame given that the restaurant has everything going for it. The food simply didn't have the wow factor. That is not to say that we didn't have an enjoyable dining experience because we did, but for once in a top end restaurant the food was not at the top of the list of reasons to be cheerful. Sorry"
181170745,50,"October 15, 2013",Unforgettable experience,"The greenhouse is a must see in Amsterdam. We didn't dine excessively well during the three weeks we spent in Europe so this was a treat. The restaurant is in an heritage greenhouse in a nice spot of greenery outside central Amsterdam (we caught tram #9 from the Centraal Station, not complicated). The set menu is more of a gastronomic degustation, varying depending on the produce which is local or grown by the restaurant itself. We were olives and bread too start, then had three light but flavoursome starters, a small main (I had the vegetarian tarte tatin with beetroot, everyone else had fish) with plentiful vegetables and a lovely dessert (the verbena ice cream was particularly memorable), although a cheese board was available too. Thoroughly enjoyable and worth every cent, great service. Perfect location for a wedding, it was very light inside and we couldn't even tell it was overcast and raining outside."
180955300,40,"October 14, 2013","""Memorable Organic Meal""","Had two-course lunch at this beautiful greenhouse restaurant. De Kas has its own greenhouses and garden near the restaurant, where they grow Mediterranean vegetables, herbs and edible flowers and served it to the table. in love with this place and the staffs are professional yet attentive and friendly."
180665121,40,"October 12, 2013","beautiful greenery, food good","I had lunch with a friend a month ago. we walked there from the the docks( long long walk!), we took a tramway on the way back to the city centre ( 20 min). the place is beautiful, lots of light coming through the greenery ( Amsterdam's light, you won't get roasted). as we arrived to the restaurant, we walked through the vegetable garden which is beautiful ; obviously enough, at least for anyone who has experience of vegetable growing, their own supply cannot cover the demand of such a restaurant, but it's good they use their herbs and what they can, anyway. the service is nice and attentive without being fussy and I appreciated it very much. The food: I remember I had some fish, with vegetables ( some pumpkin maybe?); I remember very well that I was pleased with my lunch and had a very nice time. but I can't remember what I actually ate, so I would say the food is fresh and good but not memorable. If in Amsterdam again, I would go back because my experience was very pleasant overall and the place is worth a visit."
179178018,50,"September 30, 2013",The best meal & experience I've ever had!,"Friends had told me about Da Kas, when I googled it and found the web site, I was fairly certain I was in love with these people and their concept for food, flavours and hospitality. The concept was includes a three-course tasting menu (fixed) which can often be problematic for the girl with allergies. I emailed to see if they could work around my allergies? The immediately responded letting me know that it wouldn't be a problem.A lovely man named Enno arrived to ask if we might enjoy an apero of champagne, a sparkling Riesling from the Netherlands. ""A Riesling, but then technically it's not champagne"". He concurred and let us know it was dry, not sweet, so we agreed to try it. Who knew Riesling could be so good?! They offered us delicious olives, roasted celeriac, a house made basil oil with sourdough rolls and ...(what was in that four little bowl) with our apero.I asked Enno if we might talk about my allergies to which he replied ""Yes, the kitchen is fully aware of your , you are allergic to all fish, nuts, mushrooms, melon, bananas... and the gloves made of latex"". I think my jaw dropped open and my friend replied ""That's incredible""!Chef Tommy, this great English guy came to our table with our starters and began with ""We really appreciate it when guests let us know about their dietary concerns, so thank you"". Wow, when does that ever happen? Usually, I feel like I've inconvenienced the kitchen or comprimised the chef's creativity or worse, they ignore me and think I'm just being picky. My love for Da Kas is swelling!We both started with soup of this tiny, rare potato (kate has the name written down) with fennel, flowers, greens mustard and dried, toasted onion. Tommy told us how to make the toasted onion and I can't wait to try it. Enno, paired the soup and my second starter with a lovely Bio white from the region. The soup was incredible and the wine pairing, perfect!Our second starter began with a beet root, roasted tomatoes and prosciutto for me and Kate's had beets and melon in hers, both were topped with a beet root puree which was delicious and went well with the bio white Enno had recommended.I looked at Tommy unsure about the third starter since I wasn't a fan of eggs and I never ate anything fried. He told me he could make me something different, but assured me that the egg was fired in sunflower oil and there was no possible cross contamination. I decided I was willing to give it a go. The egg was incredible! It tasted like fluffy goodness with roasted carrots and turnips. Enno had paired this starter with a rose of mostly malbec grapes, so a little darker in color. Kate's third course was a white fish (forget what) that was apparently delicious and paired well with the second white she received.Red arrived for our main course ... Tommy came out to share we would be having porc on a bed of roasted sweet potatoes and fennel, toasted pumpkin seeds, more greens and flowers and an incredible drizzle! Porc ranks bottom on the list of meats I would prefer to eat, I'd pick nearly any other gamey & fowl friends (lapin, canard or agneau) above porc, but again I was willing to give this a go! The delicious piece of perfectly cooked, saignante piece of meat in front of me, neither looked liked or tasted like ""the other white meat"" I've had in the UK or France. It was tender and delicious.Tommy came out to check on us at some point and I asked how long he had been at Da Kas? ""Well, like you I came here for dinner two years ago with my brother who was living in Amsterdam and I was so impressed ... "" I interrupted, you decided to go to culinary school? He laughed. ""No, but I went back to his apartment, printed out my CV and came back the next day. They hired me on the spot. And to tell you, kitchens can be, well difficult places to work. Here, everyone is great, like family and I'm given the opportunity to experiment and have fun doing what I love."" When I asked what Tommy might like to do in the future, he told me he was quite happy but ""Some day, I might like to go back to England to be close to family and to start something like this, where the food is inspired by what is fresh and prepared from the land. We're fortunate right now, over 80% of the ingredients are from our farms and greenhouses, come winter it's more difficult to have such variety.We decided that while we were fully satisfied we had room for the third course of dessert. The Dutch know how to pace a meal. We were presented a lovely lemon tart with house-made meringue, vanilla and berries.My love for Da Kas is about to grow exponentially! In between Enno and Tommy tending to our care, several other delightful staffers delivered, engaged and provided treats to our table. We were also given a bowl of caramelized white chocolate and cookies with our espresso.Enno ordered us a taxi and we prepared to depart, giving Tommy and the kitchen staff our regards and deep appreciation. :-> As Enno walked us to the door, he offered us apples from a giant bowl we'd passed on the way in.This was hands down the best dining experience ever!!! It was not fussy, over done, over priced or over the top. It was perfect from the first email exchange to our send off some three hours later. (LOVE +100)"
178642474,50,"September 25, 2013",Organically fresh,I found this restaurant googling gluten free eating. What a lovely place. You eat at the greenhouse where many ingredients you eat are grown. The meal starts with apps and drinks in the gardens and follows with a meal in the greenhouse which is soooo airy. Everything is so fresh and they rose to my challenge of a few food allergy issues.
178580452,50,"September 25, 2013",Truly memorable,"My best friend had her wedding here and it was fantastic. how can you NOT like dining in a gorgeous greenhouse where beautiful food is growing everywhere?

177695763,30,"September 18, 2013",We were not as impressed as many others seem to be.,"The theory is compelling: grow your own organic veggies and try to stay with locally sourced foods. We thought that for the most part the meals here were overpriced and lacking in taste. Clearly, others feel differently, but for my taste stick with Elsa's Cafe across the street at the tram stop. It's fun to take a tour of the greenhouse while you wait for your table. The location in a public park is sorta rural, and the enormous greenhouse where much of the produce is grown, is an easy-to-find landmark. Take the #9 tram from Centraal Station."

It is so peaceful and serine. We had dinner in the dining room and they did not disappoint. It is a fine dining experience and the food was wonderful! I would compare it to California cuisine (made us feel like we were home.) This would be a great romantic spot, but also perfect for a group of friends. Make sure you get a tour of the green house!"

Service is stellar, not only when compared to typical Dutch service, but also what you expect when you enter a restaurant you would qualify as classy.The food is excellent, with a menu that changes regularly. The restauranteurs grow their own produce.The restaurant also serves beers from the local brewery De Prael. The wine selection is excellent with recommendations based on the meat being served.Highly recommend the place for celebrations and corporate dinners."
175282492,20,"September 2, 2013",Boring and Expensive,I like most had been anticipating a great experience. I walked an hour and a half to get there...mostly for the exercise....thinking I was going to stuff myself....one would expect mostly vegetables or at least a lot of them....but they were really stingy with everything...and iceberg lettuce for salad...come on....the main course was fish that was just full of bones...and really nothing special to the entire meal...the best part were the tomato plants in the greenhouse which we only got 2 small dried pieces of in the salad...but the plants were really amazing....I should have just skipped the meal..I won't be back
175159117,50,"September 1, 2013",Dining under the stars,You will be sitting in a big green house and lit up olive trees. The atmosphere is great and staff very friendly. Most of the vegetables will be from the the green house or garden around you and guaranteed fresh! The set menu offers you different choices if you got allergies or dislikes. This is one of the few places where the main course (duck) is as tasty as the starters. The wine selection is good or if you prefer beer they got lots of good ones from a local brewery.Highly recommend for celebrations or special occasions.A tray of plums for the road will provide sweet memories until next time!

174728821,40,"August 29, 2013",Organic food at its best,"De Kas is what its name indicates - a working greenhouse cum organic restaurant. Beautiful, lyrical setting slightly outside the centre of town. Most of the non-protein food served are sourced right there in the adjoining garden and greenhouse, or from a nearby farm owned by the founder. There is no menu, or rather you don't know what's being served until the day of the meal. The restaurant operates on a fixed price (which is quite reasonable, given quality). The cooking really tries to make the vegetables/herbs/fruits shine, and they do - so fragrant, sweet, with unusual textures. The flavour comes from the incredible freshness of the produce rather than from seasonings or complex cooking techniques, so amateurs of hearty cajun rib eye steak, BBQ pork ribs or lamb vindaloo (like myself) might find the food a bit bland. However, if you eat slowly to savour the food, you will discover the earth's bounty. I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed. Unusual wine list with among others, a light and surprisingly good Dutch red wine. Friendly and helpful service."

The staff were very attentive and friendly, we were shown the fixed price menu and the wine list, however, we chose to go with a wine recommendation per course as it was our last day in Amsterdam. The food was served like a tasting menu with the waiters explaining where each of the ingredients came from, the wine was served with the same explanation. We opted for the additional cheese course as well and this was great too. I found the whole experience was really good and recommend this place even though its someway out of Amsterdam by tram unless you are staying the the Manor Hotel."

Everyone was so kind, playful and, above all, professional. Loved watching the people in the kitchen --real pros and real harmonious creating. They mentioned something about 5 courses at the onset but it felt like food kept coming all night! Every bite is a thoughtful creation of amazing sensations. If you don't sit at the chef's table still ask for their recommendations for a wine to accompany each course. They really know how to beautifully combine the bubbly with the gastronomy.

The setting is fabulous and very original although off the beaten track from central Amsterdam. They seated around 25 of us in one room (greenhouse) and talked us through all the food we were eating. The sharing type food was perfect for us and something which is growing in popularity in London. The quality of food, service ad environment was excellent."

You are seated in a large green house looking local with a high ceiling and a modern interior. The service is excellent, warm and friendly. The food is fresh, simple and focused. De Kas serves a fixed menu - choice of meat or vegetarian. One of the most charming things with the restaurant is that they pick edible flowers from the garden, and in season, vegetables and fruit from their greenhouse. They do have a larger green house on a farm outside of Amsterdam where they get most of their food supplies from. A great place for ending a busy day on the town.

The servers are friendly, knowledgeable, good looking and helpful. Yet the salad containing the freshest possible ingredients was rather boring and the main course that night which was a veal ribeye with a rubesco sauce needed seasoning.. You will feel really good about yourself for eating here. It has all the buzzwords ""local,"" ""sustainable,"" ""organic"" but for me it had lots of zippedy but no doodah."

There was a tomato, eggplant, mixed bean and herb salad; a veal pastrami salad with wonderfully prepared sweetbreads on zuchinni ribons; sweet, bay shrimp soup; grilled hake on Dutch fingerling potatoes with capers, a paper-thin slice of Rose Queen turnip and a grilled fennel bulb. Two wines came with the lunch for a 4-Euro supplemnt. We also ordered coffee and dessert - a homemade black cherry, chocolate ice cream served with chocolate sponge cake and fresh currants and bing cherries.Service was attentive, friendly and very acommodating. We arrived when De Kas opened and stayed the afternoon because the setting was so enchanting and relaxing. Staff never hurried us. We would highly recommend De Kas to people who like good, fresh, organic and well-sourced food served in a garden setting. We took the Number 9 tram from downtown (Spuy) to the Hogeweg stop, walked across a bridge over a pond full of blooming waterlillies to reach the restaurant. A great Amsterdam afternoon outdoors."
169663216,50,"July 29, 2013",Magical Evening at De Kas,"I read about De Kas and made a reservation based on a magazine article: an article or a review cannot even capture this restaurant! We had a booking for a party of six but then wrote to expand our group and were asked if we would like to have the business table: which was a WONDERFUL move! Upon arrival, we were dropped off at a bridge into a park. We had a lovely walk over the bridge, where local families were just hanging out: a local baker was putting loaves of bread out for ducks, and the whole relaxed and lovely scene began our evening. Upon entering De Kas, we were invited out to the terrace to tour the beautiful herb and flower garden to have a drink before dinner: our server, Jarl was charming from the start and gave a tour where we could taste a few plants and learn more about how the restaurant began and the way that De Kas continues to operate. This gave us time to take in the unique setting: he set the whole tone for the evening by saying we should relax and come to the table whenever we were ready. The menu is based on what is fresh and interests the chef: Jarl asked if we had allergies or dislikes that they should work around: after taking stock, the chef began to create and we enjoyed being served 'surprise' dishes. Our starters came out: three choices to taste: all were excellent, fresh, organic, and filled with flavor. Our main course was fresh fish and a melange of vegetables: cooked to perfection. The freshness and flavor of the food was unparalleled in any other setting or restaurant. The service was welcoming and responsive: Jarl gave us local tips for our visit to Nederlands. We are now back home, and one of the party was talking with me and mentioned that De Kas was the high point of the trip!"

A set meal awaits dinners and on the day we visited that meant broad bean and pea risotto, hake, watermelon ice cream. But that doesn't give any idea of this amazing food presented lovingly. Plates dressed with edible flowers, fresh seasonal vegetables and fine sauces created by expert chefs. You'll need to save a few pence.....our 3 course lunch for 2 came to 105 Euros..... Worth every penny."

167517473,50,"July 14, 2013",Delicious Gourmet healthy Food,This was our second visit to De Kas (we went two years ago on a previous visit to Amsterdam). We love this restaurant. Not only is it light and spacious (it is located in a greenhouse) but the food is delicious as well as being healthy. Much of the food is grown on the premises and we had a look round the greenhouse where the fruit and vegetables are grown before our meal. The courses are delicate and exquisite but substantial enough too. The service is impeccable and the wine list good. One of our favourite restaurants in the world.
166916318,40,"July 9, 2013",Good food - Great Wines,"Throughout a meal in the atmospheric De Kas one suspects that the staff tries to make your meal memorable. To a degree they succeed. Located in a prime location, De Kas is a good restaurant for a special occasion. Full of ambiance the concept seems set on a creating a place with a lot of light (we went in summer) and a more then usual amount of waiters for a typical Dutch restaurant. De Kas tries too much to be nice in my opinion and the service tends to be stiff. It offers interesting dishes, especially the entrees with some of the best mozzarella cheese I have ever tasted. Having grown most of its produce the flavors are interesting but not definite. One can eat better vegetables in other places. The dishes with violets and other flowers are good and correct. The asparagus we were offered from Venlo were excellent. Maybe the best of the meal are the wines which really combine well with the veal and other dishes. Eating in the De Kas is an interesting experience and advancement in Dutch cuisine. One word of advice is to try different wines with the starters, the main course and the desserts."
166890149,50,"July 9, 2013",Absolutely wonderful,"Is this place worth the walk from the center of Amsterdam:? Absolutely. It takes about 30 mins to get there but it's a really nice walk past some universities and parks, and the restaurant is in another park itself. We have learnt ""De Kas"" means ""greenhouse"", and that's exactly what this place is - a greenhouse that serves food using the vegetables grown in the greenhouse (a tour of the greenhouse is encouraged). How more local can you get? However, this would all be a gimmick if the food was not any good. But it is: we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch menu. The vegetables were fresh (obviously) and very well prepared, and the meat was great, too (from local farmers). We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal in Amsterdam."
166798529,50,"July 8, 2013",What a great experience!,De Kas is situated in a lovely park and is surrounded by beautiful gardens. The chef selects the menu for the day based on what is available in their own gardens. There is no printed menu but the server will take into account any dietary preferences. A delicious meal served by attentive staff. I suggest you begin your evening with a drink on the terrace and enjoy the view.
166385536,50,"July 5, 2013",Great experience,"We had lunch here on a weekday. Not cheap, but it's worth every penny. The place looks great, the dining area is in the middle of a greenhouse. Adjacent to it, there is an actual greenhouse where many of the fruits and vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, melons) actually used in the dishes are grown. Whatever is not grown on site, is sourced locally from small farmers. There is a fixed menu, based on whatever is available seasonally. We got first a bowl of large olives, pickled cucumbers and delicious bread while we waited. Then 3 small dishes as appetizers, and finally a main course (fish, but it was possible to exchange it for veal). Everything was delicious, the service was very prompt and courteous. It would be very interesting to see it in the dark as well, the atmosphere must be very different! Will have to visit again in winter time..."

165762895,50,"June 30, 2013",Nicola's Birthday visit,"Six of us went here on Wednesday 26th June to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday. The evening experience far exceeded any expectations that we may have had. From our initial arrival up to our departure we were made to feel special by all staff. Our waiter Hassan looked after us throughout the meal, explaining each dish and each wine that accompanied each course (we chose the wine pairing, highly recommended). It was explained to us that they grow their own produce (some on site, some in a larger greenhouse off site), meat and fish is also sourced locally. The set menu is changed weekly dependant upon produce available. Please do not be put off by a set menu as this did give us an opportunity to try dishes that you may not otherwise choose, all six of us enjoyed every single dish that was put in front of us, both the presentation and quality of the dishes was amazing. The enthusiasm demonstrated by staff included an opportunity for us to be shown around the on site greenhouse and other areas of the restaurant including the kitchen by one of the Chefs, this proved to be both interesting and informative in relation to it's history. The restaurant is built inside a beautifully restored municipal greenhouse incorporating one large dining area with a number of smaller dining areas attached, although this may sound strange it does look amazing. The atmosphere is very relaxed and you are not rushed at any point during your visit (we were there for five and a half hours). You can reach the Restaurant quite easily by tram (number 9 from the central station stops right outside) or by taxi. For all of us the visit turned out to be very special and has left us with a fantastic memory of my wife's birthday that will stay with us for a very long time. Thank you to everyone at De Kas."
165731399,50,"June 30, 2013",De Kas experience,"A surprise visit with friends for a 50th birthday celebration.we were amazed to see we were eating in giant greenhouses with vegetable and flower gardens surrounding it.The restaurant change their menu weekly and use all the produce they grow both on site and in a nearby village.All other fish and meat etc is sourced locally.the menu is fixed as is the price, and you can also choose to have your wine chosen by the restaurant for each course which is what we did.3 starters,main meal,a choice of cheese platter if required and a sweet.There were 6 of us each with different likes and dislikes,yet we all cleared our plates on every course!!Food was fresh,different and incredibly tasty with the chosen wines complimenting the food.We were given a tour of the greenhouses,a tour of the kitchens and every course was explained to us with its ingredients.For us it was an amazing experience with all the staff being so committed to, and proud of,the restaurant and its ideals.A meal and experience none of us will ever forget- a must do for anyone visiting Amsterdam."
165665388,50,"June 29, 2013","Wonderful, home-grown food in a park to the south of town","Frankedael Park starts at Hogewort, fairly far out the #9 tram line. Walk a bit further along its street to the entrance to the park and this restaurant, that grows its own veggies on site and supplements them with deliciously prepared meats and fish. We were there for a celebration, so did not see a menu but I will certainly celebrate what we were served, for freshness, variety, and taste. Reservations required."
165406608,40,"June 27, 2013",Fantastic fresh food in a green oase in Amsterdam,"This restaurant has a daily changing fixed menu. There are no choices, although they will easily accomodate your preferences like vegetarian or 'no fish'. What is really nice are the veggies: they are very original and tasty and fresh. The quality of all the food is very good. Good wine selection, also by the glass. The environment of a greenhouse in a park is really nice.The starter consisted of 3 fantastic little plates - which were served all at the same time. This was a bit of a pity, since they were not so hot anymore by the time we got to the last of the three starters. On top, these starters are a full dish in itself. My wife decided to skip the main course after this.Service is personal and professional. Good choice if you are visiting Amsterdam, it is also a bit of away from the beaten path in a nice part of Amsterdam."
165080458,50,"June 24, 2013",Excellent meal in a greenhouse,Gorgeous greenhouse surrounded by a park was a perfect place for our last dinner in Amsterdam. The menu is a prix fixe and they can accommodate requests (I don't eat red meat) without an issue. The food was really excellent and the service was great. Would definitely recommend this to anyone in Amsterdam.
164917602,50,"June 23, 2013","Wonderful, fresh dinner","The setting of this restaurant in the park is lovely. The restaurant has a lot of glass and its own greenhouse where they grow many of the veggies. The menu is a 3-course setmenu; you don't order your choice. All the dishes were fresh, unique and delicious!"
164608743,40,"June 20, 2013",Organic Experience,"It is quite a taxi ride to get here but worth it for the experience. The produce is grown on the grounds and all the ingredients as local as possible. It is a set menu with no choice so you must be adventurous to dine here. It is about 50 euros per with a 25 euro wine pairing which was worth it. As we arrived, a local family was arriving there on bikes to dine. There were many bikes parked outside, a good sign I think. The service was cordial and good after one mishap."
164571446,50,"June 20, 2013",Fantastic Food and Experience,"A great meal, beautifully presented, well proportioned, and delicious. We will visit every year with pleasure."
164423851,30,"June 18, 2013",too big for its own good,"this restaurant is what I`d call pretentious. The dining room is enormous, terrible acoustics, the tables are placed such that you sit nearer the person at the table next to you than the person with whom you`re eating. All this detracts from the food, which I`m sure was delicious, although I can`t remember it. Outrageously expensive. It's the sort of place tv celebs go to."
164349990,50,"June 18, 2013","Great experience, all around","Arrived in AMS on a Saturday afternoon and was able to book the kitchen table two days later.Beautiful setting and the service was incredible friendly. Each new staff member who delivered something to our table introduced themselves and shook our hands. That wouldn't happen in the states!All beverages were included in the cost and they were very generous with the wine and bottled premium water.The restaurant was fairly empty when we sat, just before seven, but was full a short time later. It was fun watching the kitchen rev up and push plates out.One of our dishes was a garden platter- literally. Edible flowers and just picked vegetables. So different and interesting.Food was very good. Simple presentations. Very dutch.After out mains were served, we were taken on a tour by one of the chefs. That was fun and we got to sample a few more deceivingly edible plants. If you can try the leaves of an oyster plant, do it!After 5 hours there, we closed down the restaurant and could not even finish the dessert wine pairings, we were so satiated. Plus, we had to ride bikes back to our apartment."
164321859,50,"June 17, 2013",Unbelievable!,"Definitely a meal I will never forget and in my top 5 restaurant experiences of all time. Dined at the chef's table and I would highly recommend this option. I truly think it is the best value and you can't beat the experience. The entire staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The restaurant occupies a beautifully renovated greenhouse with a large on-site fresh herb and veggie garden. There is no set menu as each day is different and depends on what is fresh and ready to eat from their local growers and suppliers. It is not vegetarian but I would say that the bulk of the courses are veggie-centric. Wow! What they can do with veggies. Bas, the head chef, was fantastic. His passion for his work is evidenced by the amazing flavor and presentation of each dish. I would be a strict vegetarian if I could cook like these folks! Each of the 7 (or eight? or nine?) courses was paired with wine/champagne and the sommelier took the time to describe the drink and the logic behind the pairing. She (Tessa, I believe her name was?) was kind enough to print out the wine list for the evening for us. The restaurant is located a bit outside of ""downtown"" Amsterdam so a car/cab is necessary but well worth the drive. Be sure to book far in advance, particularly for the chef's table. Will definitely be back!!! (Visited in June 2011)"
163970042,40,"June 14, 2013","Wonderful food, disappointing service","In the past this was one of my favourite places to have lunch. The food is delicious and very fresh. The menu changes constantly and I have no complaints there. However, it is not cheap and therefore I was extremely disappointed when having lunch to have to request service (we wanted to order a bottle of wine) and were left sitting for a long time, whilst all the tables around us were served and we were ignored. The situation did not improve after the main course had been served. We were not asked if we would like a dessert or coffee - they just ignored us! We managed to catch the eye of the lady who was clearing tables and she was kind enough to bring us our bill. I don't know when I last had such poor service and will not be hurrying back. It is such a shame."
163875574,50,"June 13, 2013","A wonderful, relaxing meal","I went to De Kas with a small group of friends for lunch and had a fantastic experience. The restaurant has an amazing location in the middle of a park that provides a nice break from the city. The food on the set menu was fantastic and the portion sizes were good. The meal included a white fish and several appetizers all garnished with vegetables grown on-site in the restaurant's greenhouse. The set menu was fairly priced for what they give you. While slightly hard to find from the city center, this hidden gem is well worth the trip."
163480418,40,"June 9, 2013",Great experience,The setting is fresh and setting welcoming. Food was good but it is expensive for what it is. Best service I have received in Amsterdam. Beautiful restaurant. I would go again and recommend it for a special occasion
163388023,40,"June 8, 2013",Very nice surprise,"Nice cuisine in a perfect spot. The staff are friendly and helpfull. Just prepare to pay a lot. Still, a must go place to feel the Amsterdam ambience."
162452416,30,"May 30, 2013",Too risky for the price,"Although the service is great, the place beautiful and the food fresh and well made it's not for everyone. The only available menu put you at risk that big part of your meal doesn't fit you. Expensive prices, especially in wines, made it too risky too try."
161921626,40,"May 26, 2013",Unique Restaurant but you need to pick your night.,This is a great setting in an old but modernized green house. This was chosen for us by the concierge at the hotel as I wanted something away from the touristy area. It was a 15 Euro taxi ride but the experience if not the food was worth the drive. This location has a fixed menu for the night for all patrons. It happened to be a fish night when we went and it was OK but not worth the 190 Euro’s it cost. Would suggest you book it yourself and ask what the menu for the evening will be to ensure it is something you want.
161840848,50,"May 25, 2013",Perfect all around,"I just had a fantastic dinner at De Kas. We were a group of 12 and had a nice space where we could speak across the table without being disruptive to the rest of the restaurant. The location is beautiful, both inside the restaurant as well as the view and the gardens that surround it. The food is almost all locally grown or raised, extremely fresh and wholesome. No menu, whatever is in season is what is prepared, and it is delicious. Highly recommend!"
161581674,40,"May 23, 2013",Remarkable if not amazing,"I visited recently off of the back of strong recommendations. First impressions are fantastic the service is polite, professional and friendly, plus you really can't help but be drawn to the assortment of plants being grown in the part of the greenhouse that still serves its original function. The dinning room is perfectly converted.The food however is not quite to the highest standard. It is still very good, but struggles with too many flavours fighting for attention. I would have thought with the concentration being on producing their own ingredients that each would be given more care."
161148773,50,"May 19, 2013",Still going strong,This place was really innovative when they started... Organic food from their own ground. After years it's still providing great value/ quality for money... We went for the lunch menu and it was really good.
160768037,40,"May 15, 2013","Excellent ambience, average food","With a reservation, we visited the restaurant as a Mother'Day evening celebration. As previous reviewers have noted, the restaurant serves a fixed choice menu at a fixed price, but will provide alternatives if diners have an allergy or an aversion to all or part of the choice offered. For our visit, we all chose the 3 course fixed choice menu with wine pairings to match at a cost of some 70 euros per person. The starter course that evening was a medley of three different dishes - a grilled baby cos salad with croutons and old Dutch cheese, a white asparagus with egg and Jerusalem artichokes, and a quail roulade with beetroot. The medley was well presented but did not provide outstanding tastes. The main course comprised a filet of roast catfish wrapped in Serrano ham and served on a bed of black lentils with bok choy. The fish was cooked to perfection but again, the dish did not have the wow factor one might have expected. The desert course was an excellent rice pudding with a rhubarb coulis, a white chocolate saboyan and pistacho ice cream. Overall, the ambience of the restaurant is unique and tables are far enough separated as to not be bothered by adjacent diners. The service was both pleasant and knowledgable, although a minor glitch did occur when, after an inordinate wait, we had to request our desert course. However, the manageress did apologize for the glitch and offered us complimentary coffee and petit fours for the delay. Upon departure, the two mothers in our party each received a tomato plant from the adjacent hot house. In summary, the restaurant is worth a visit from the ambience alone but the limited menu and relatively high prices for the fare on offer are detractions to the experience."
160191364,40,"May 9, 2013",Nice atmosphere. You can see the stork nest from the glass roof,"Excellent service, very professional. The starters were very good and various. The ingredients are natural, only seasonal vegetables. The location is very nice. It is situated in a park, with a pond and a couple of chimneys where storks have their nests.Fish and meat are cooked in a very natural way.The menu is fixed by the restaurant, you can only specify if you're vegetarian or vegan... It is a take or leave it situation.The dessert was very refreshing and not too sweet."
160180782,50,"May 9, 2013","Beautiful place, beautiful food","A pleasure in every way. There's no menu, you just have what's fresh and available that day, but of course they will accommodate any special eating or dietary requirements. We went there for lunch today and it was a joy. Service excellent and food really fresh and delicious. Please note that public transport is by Tram not Metro!"

159443164,40,"May 2, 2013","Very good, not exceptional","Our friends treated us to lunch here. The building is beautiful - storks and birds in the park it is located inside, beautiful flowers and surroundings. The interior was also nice - very open and bright as it is made to look like an atrium. We were greeted in a professional manner and taken to our reserved table. The set menu was nice - their take on beet soup was delicious. Portions were an OK size - perhaps not large enough for the men folk;). Service was OK - we often had to serve our own water and wine (which is fine, but when you are paying such a high price for the experience, this is something that is usually done for you). Dessert was nice, not amazing. Even though I liked the experience, I left feeling like I wanted more or expected more. This place has great PR and is known to be the best Amsterdam has to offer - but I thought it was very good, not quite deserving of all the accolades and top notch reviews."
159204478,50,"April 29, 2013",Absolutely Loved It,"This place is top notch. We had the Chef's Table on a recent Monday and it was an amazing experience. Really one if the best I have been to anywhere. But be prepared, we arrived at 7 and left at 11:30, literally closing the place down. The food was phenomenal as mentioned here but I think the service is what really takes the cake. So very comfortable yet very professional and very accommodating. The setting is beautiful. This restaurant is a real gem and not to be missed."
158558655,50,"April 23, 2013",Greenhouse effect,This is da place. Let's have a restaurant in a greenhouse! And we did. Own vegetables and herbs and stuff. Friendly staff. Carefully made food nice wines and cozy atmosphere away from the towns fuss. Very nice and fresh!
158357346,40,"April 21, 2013",Worth the trip!,"Abolutely worth the trip to the suburbs. Fantastic settings, and teir use of ""home grown"" vegetables and local raw ingredients and wine really works. De Kas isn't cheap, and it's located a bit out of the centre, but it's an experience well worth the money and the trip."
158214333,50,"April 19, 2013",Stunning with great food,This restaurant is a stunning space. De Kas has gardens in which they grow some of the vegetables and ingredients that they use each day. The menu changes with what is available daily. This is a set dinner so each course is a surprise. The food was beautifully plated and very good. Service was excellent. We really enjoyed our meal here.
158132623,30,"April 18, 2013",Expected more...,"When we first arrived the service was excellent and the ""magic"" was built up from not telling what to serve until it was time to get the food on the table, so far it was great... but when we were asked for what to drink, they could not recommend any good wine for the food, which I felt they should have been possible to do easily. The food was ok, but not something extra to be honest, good and well cooked, but not meeting the expectations after the introduction of the restaurant.Well worth to visit once, just because it's a cool place and nice with all local food.."
158048406,50,"April 17, 2013",Perfection,"We had an amazing meal from start to finish. The service was warm, and helpful. The space is beautiful and charming with a great view. The sesonal 3 course meal was amazing."

A bit away from the buzzy centre but easy reachable with the Tram (number 9) The place is beautiful and approaching it from the street already gives you an idea what will happen next. Service is professional and friendly. The set menu is very good. No outstanding taste experience of a specific ingredient but the symphony of taste is a lasting memory. All fresh, all bio all good.Good wine menu and a lot of attention to detail. We will be back!170 Euro for 2"
158013725,50,"April 17, 2013",A different experience,I have wanted to visit this restaurant for many years since Sarah Raven mentioned that it was the inspiration for her greenhouse/restaurant at her gardens. It is quite a long way from the central attractions of Amsterdam so you may want to factor in the cost of taxis if you don't want to walk to the tram late at night. It is set in a small field and you walk across a short bridge to reach the restaurant which is in a large modern greenhouse setting. Service was friendly if a little slow for us. The menu is a set 3 course menu but they will take into account things that you don't like. Vegetables are grown in the greenhouse and all products are local and well sourced. The food is quite simple but tasty and we enjoyed being able to have matching half glasses of wine with each course. We have a lovely relaxing evening and recommend a visit - you will need to book in advance as the evening we went it was fully booked.
157809536,50,"April 15, 2013","Greenhouse-Gourmet Concept, a cracker","Largely home-grown or at least carefully selected vegetables, fish and meats end up on your plate here. It is a classy but not a conventional restaurant. Freshness jumps off your plate. I have been 5-7 times now and have not been disappointed. OK, jazzed-up grilled onions as a starter is pushing it a bit. Lamb, fish have alwys been wonderful. Not cheap but worth it. More than enough staff that is enthusiastic and able (a rare combination) with attention to detail. Cosmopolitan atmosphere is uplifting. Recommend it to anyone who has not completely lost his/her sense of curiosity."
157677007,50,"April 14, 2013",Loved the experience!,"From the moment we sat down we were greeted by a friendly staff who started our evening off with a glass of sparkling wine. Our meal was absolutely delicious - farm to table style dining is something we enjoy. Loved the three starters served family style. The wine list has some good French selections - our favorite.We did the cheese course and it was quite tasty. After dinner, we toured the greenhouse with Tommy, one of the chefs - which was just phenomenal to see and hear how much they grow. Hassan was our server, who was just a joy. We will definitely be back - hopefully in nicer weather to enjoy their beautiful patio!"
157309213,50,"April 10, 2013","Wonderful food, service, location and gluten free friendly","Gluten-free has never been so tasty. We understood that the restaurant only served one fixed meal each evening. I am gluten-free and my husband does not eat fish. Therefore, we called ahead to see if our dietary requirements would cause a problem. They assured us they could accommodate us. They did much more! They had special gluten-free bread for me when I arrived so that I could enjoy the snacks at the table. Anyone who is gluten-free knows what a treat this is - and unexpected. We had a glass of sparkling wine and enjoyed the beautiful views of the park. The three appetizers were delicious. Again, they fixed one of them special for my husband who does not eat fish. The main course and dessert (again, fixed gluten-free for me) were scrumptious. The meal was well paced and the service was attentive without being fussy. I highly recommend this restaurant and will visit again when in Amsterdam - Bravo De Kax"
157117833,50,"April 8, 2013",Amazing... just Amazing!,Everything about our experience at De Kas was perfect. We went with kids and were all treated so well. The menu was perfect. Both the adults and kids loved their meals. Can't wait to visit again.
156790466,40,"April 6, 2013",Very good Fixed Course dinner,"First time we have had a meal where we have NO choice of food to order. This restaurant makes one three course meal each night based on fresh ingredients available. You either like what they choose to make, or you don't.IF you like this concept, this is a very fine restaurant. Three small appetizers served to everyone , family style, then Cod as main course and couple desserts.Half our group liked the food; half were less than satisfied."
156771110,20,"April 6, 2013","Great atmosphere, bland food","I visited De Kas last week and was left quite underwhelmed by the experience.The setting itself is beautiful and I was excited to see the greenhouses where the produce is grown. The service was attentive without being too fussy, however we were served by many staff which I wasn't too keen on. If I'm leaving a tip I like to know who it goes to.Sadly, the food wasn't as interesting as I was anticipating. The starter was a cold potato salad, a bean broth and an oyster. The main was (chewy) guinea fowl with accompaniments which added nothing to the dish and the desert was a trifle type arrangement. (The white chocolate ice cream on top was the highlight of the menu). No flavour or excitement, and the oyster apart, I'd say the ingredients didn't reflect the price of the menu. There wasn't much ""cooking"" involved and most elements could have been pre-prepared earlier in the day.It's a shame, I'd travelled a distance to try De Kas and had really been looking forward to it. I won't be returning on my next visit to the city."
156709728,40,"April 5, 2013","Very pretty setting, solid food","Take a taxi to this restaurant in a greenhouse. Make a reservation. The food is solid, not extraordinary. It is basically a set menu, but they will adjust to any food requests."

156581756,20,"April 4, 2013","Great service, tasteless food","I should have taken Susan's comment seriously. I was fooled by so many great comments. Anyway, i couldnt wait to take my daughter there. it was a long way from where we stayed but since it had so many good reviews i thought it would be a nice thing to do with my daughter. we took 2 trams to get there; regardless of 35 minutes on the trams, when we got there, we were so impressed with the setting . The place is Gorgeous! The staff was wonderful. However, the sad truth is that Susan was right. Once we sat down, we were served with Italian olives, mushrooms and bread. For the first course: soup, salad, fish appetizer; and the main course was another fish. The soup was ok; the salad had no taste whatsoever; and for the appertizer, i only could taste the salt in the fish and no other flavor, no spices. After that I thought maybe the main course would have some flavor. But sadly it tasted the same as the appetizer, TASTELESS, although the fish was a good fish. The only item we enjoyed eating was the bread.I left the place feeling very disappointed, especially traveling so far and spent that kind of money for lunch. For those who are looking good fine food, this is not a place."
156499882,50,"April 3, 2013",Wonderful memorable meal,"My wife and I and another couple were going to Amsterdam in January and we were looking for interesting places to eat - I came across this place on the internet and immediately thought that it looked a little out of the ordinary - a converted glasshouse in a park that grows a lot of it's own produce in attached glasshouses and has a set menu i.e. you don't choose and the food is brought to you. We were able to book a table on short notice (it was January) and essential that you do as it gets very busy through most of the year. Turned up in the snow and thought 'a greenhouse in the snow in winter?!'. A lovely warm welcome and corresponding warm restaurant were what ensued. The menu was explained and we were asked if there was anything we didn't eat (there wasn't but they would have organised an alternative). We also took the option of having wines matched to each course (their choice). What followed was a wonderful dining experience, each course a surprise, carefully presented and cooked to a tee. The selected wines went incredibly well with each course and again, lovely not knowing what was coming. Not cheap but as a special treat this is top end. Plus, when we were leaving, the snow was coming down quite hard and they gave us an umbrella to get to the taxi - 'don't worry about sending it back' they said. One of the previous reviews slated the food and the wine as they were surprised at what came - don't go with a closed mind and you will enjoy every minute!"
156491061,20,"April 3, 2013","Lovely place, great staff - shame about the food","Having booked this restraurant well in advance, and coming from Scotland to Amsterdam for a long weekend with the girls - we were looking forward to this very much. It offers a fixed menu for a week at a time, and the location was quite central and the entrance and the restraurant was lovely.... that is where the good review ends I'm afraid, we went to our table and already sitting on all the tables were `stale' bread rolls. The waitress was attentive and nice and did ask if there was anything we didn't like, which we answered `lamb & mushrooms'. The starter was a seletion of 3 items, a selection of beans in olive oil, a salad - both of which were tasteless and low and behold oysters... that on further investigation did not look like they had been cleaned. The main was guinea fowl, it was over cooked, over powering and the items that accompanied this were pretty pointless, on a plus I enjoyed the dessert, which was trifle, my only critisism here would be the apples still had their skin on, my 2 friends did not enjoy the dessert. When the waitress came to clear the plates, I had left all the contents of my main meal and they didn't say anything, we paid the full amount and promptly left. Having read some of the other reviews, I would suggest others' to try but to have a very open mind about the items that may be served to them."

Have never been treated so well by the friendliest of staff who were incredibly attentive, yet it still felt like we were given space and left alone. Lovely venue (not that far out of town, 15mins on tram).Can't recommend enough. Sixth time to Amsterdam and the best meal we've ever had there.

There is a set menu but they do accommodate food allergies etc. A wonderful space to dine in and very friendly and warm staff. But of course the best part of the experience was the food. Delicious! We were immediately served with bread and olive oil, olives and mushrooms. Then the set menu was explained to us and substitutions agreed. 3 little starters duly arrived....they really do know how to combine their ingredients....but for me the best bit was the main course....the best duck that I have ever eaten...perfectly cooked with no trace of fat and a flavour which lingered ...well until the dessert!...a course I usually avoid but once tasted had to be polished off.....an evening to remember....do go there if you can"

While always a bit nerve-wracking when there's no menu to pick from, each and every dish they served was top-notch and delicious. Even my girlfriend, who can be a bit picky at times, loved her meal. Highly recommend you eat here next time you're in Amsterdam!!"
155180609,50,"March 20, 2013",Pure joy,"Our visit to De Kas was pure joy. The whole concept takes locavore cuisine to a new level when the cooks use the vegetables and herbs grown directly in the greenhouse attached to the restaurant. The set menu was well balanced and the flavors were great. The wines offered to go with the menu were great, too. We also liked the interiors - very airy and light (well, it's a greenhouse after all)."
155108522,50,"March 19, 2013",One of the best meals I have ever had.....,"What an amazing surprise. I was lucky enough to go here on a business dinner. First of all, the place is in a Greenhouse and they grow a great deal of their own food (0 KM movement as it is called in Europe). There are three set courses and on the night we were there, all were just amazing.We had just been in Italy for almost a week and this blew away anything we had in Italy....Our service was great, wine was great, food was just mind-blowing. The food all feels very light and healthy. If this were in my hometown, I would go at least once a month if not more. The quality of the food is worth the price. We tried to go back before leaving but they were fully booked. I will tell everyone I know to go to this place."
155052256,50,"March 19, 2013",A delightful experience,"What's outstanding about this restaurant is the location and the atmosphere. The restaurant is essentially a renovated greenhouse which gives the place a night light and open atmosphere. It is thoughtfully designed and the surroundings are comfortable. It is situated within a park, so you get an almost ""countryside"" feel as you approach it while walking around the park - you certainly don't feel like you are in one of the busiest cities on earth!The staff and service are excellent and very friendly, and happy to make time to chat to the diners.The food was very good. The menu changes based on what's available from their own gardens and local suppliers so you can always expect something new. They were very happy to take my dietary requirements into account (gluten- and mostly lactose-free). Overall it was delicious and went down well with some excellent wine, recommended by our waiter.A nice place to go to if you're looking for something a little different. Be sure to book early though. I tried booking five days in advance and they were full. However, they put me on a waiting list and called me three days later to offer me a table."

154380508,50,"March 12, 2013",Absolutely fantastic. A real experience. Great food!,"This restaurant did not disappoint. I have read a lot of the reviews, and we chose this restaurant from a food blog and some other reviews online. It is a fantastic restaurant, approximately 4km or 18mins by tram 9 (central station leaving point). The restaurant is absolutely beautiful in its decor - a rebuilt greenhouse/glasshouse that was redone from its original blueprint. The place has been open for over 12 years now, and its absolutely gorgeous. The ambiance is fantastic, with tables that are large and far enough away from any other patrons that you won't be bothered. We went on a tuesday night and the restaurant main area (there are a few areas, which include function rooms etc) wasn't that full - perfect for us.The food is sourced locally, or grown within their own glasshouse or offsite on their own ""farm"", and you can tell. The food is fresh and terrific. The menu changes regularly, to allow them to use their own freshest ingredients. We had dinner, which gave us a 3 course meal, including 3 starters, a main and dessert. The food was great, and I won't go into specifics, so you can go and enjoy it yourself!Service was A grade, prompt, friendly, knowledgable and with a smile. We went on a short tour after our meal, to view their greenhouse and the other various areas of the restaurant. A really nice touch. Our waitress was A grade.Normally you would need to book. We did it online via email and received our confirmation. We probably didn't need to book for the night we went there, but I would definitely recommend booking to avoid being turned away.This was the best meal we had in Amsterdam.(Other recent restaurnt highlights were Viajante, Town hall hotel, London)"
154282316,40,"March 11, 2013","good experience overall but not a ""must"" in my book","We recently celebrated our wedding anniversary here. People aren't kidding when they say it's a bit out of the way. When we were trying to get there, the tram conductor told us that due to construction, the tram would not take us all the way to the restaurant, we'd have to take a bus, then walk. We exited the tram and took a taxi. From the city center, it was about EUR 16. I'd highly recommend this option.The restaurant boasts an impressive glass walls and ceiling, the space near the bar (especially the fireplace) is particularly inviting.The food was very good (loved the carrots/mustard and olive 'pre-appetizers' and the sourdough bread that came with them), as others have said, and dietary restrictions were accommodated. The lamb (the main course) was served very rare. When the server noticed that I was barely eating it (I like my meat medium well), she offered to bring me another one (and did - much better). They brought a special plate with a couple of sweets and ""Congratulations"" written in chocolate in honor of our anniversary.Overall a pleasant dinner, but I would not say that I was so blown away that I'd make it a must for each visit to Amsterdam. It was a nice experience, but probably a one-time visit for me."
153894330,50,"March 6, 2013",Superb.,The Greenhouse . Very organic and not something you see everyday.The kitchen was open and the fact that they had a kitchen table was also just amazing.Very chic and the service is something to write home about.

Its a bit off the centre (easy to get there though) but this is actually an advantage as the surroundings (park and a greenhouse) are very relaxing and let you forget the craziness of the city centre.The majority of veggies are from their own production; there is also a nice selection of wine, and they are willing to prepare for you a special menu in case you have some allergies.Fully recommended whenever you are looking for a romantic dinner, dinner with friends or family or you just enjoy really good food, service and atmosphere."
153272484,50,"February 27, 2013",Perfect dining experience,"A full pack restaurant: pretty setting, nice decoration, not too quiet, not too loud, amazing food and great service.If you’re looking for fine dining in Amsterdam, this is one of the places to come. The dinner menu is always a surprise. I was a little scared that the main course would be steak, or some heavy meat, since I’m not a big fan, but luckily it was an amazing fish. But don’t worry if you’re strictly vegetarian, they got you covered as well.If you’re a tourist, It’s a little far from the city center and the main attraction, but tram 9 goes directly there."
152745551,40,"February 21, 2013","Nice food, great ambience, perfect for a business dinner","I had supper at De Kas along with my colleagues recently. The ambience of the place is fantastic. The staff was very courteous and treated us with respect. We has three dishes for the first course, all diverse and quite tastefully aranged, one for the second (some places have two) and one dessert. The ingredients used were fresh and the preparation was quite appetizing and tasty. The attention to detail was very nicely done. The person who served us explained us every dish thoroughly. Being a fan of cookery shows, it was easy for us to understand, but for others who were amongst the uninitiated, the server explained in brief about th preparation of the food item on their plate. We had people with multiple diet preferences, and the food served catered to everybody without discrimination. Frankly, we Indians are not used to French food or Haute Couture in food as some people may put it, but the experience that we had at De Kas has definitely helped in altering our mindset and made us more open as far as experimenting other food cultures is concerned. I am sure I will be viiting De Kas pretty soon."

152724573,50,"February 21, 2013",A unique and visually spectacular venue for a wonderful dining experience,"My wife and booked our table ahead of our visit to Amsterdam because we got the impression from the web site that eating here was going to be special. We found it to be not just special, but spectacular. On arrival we walked over a wooden bridge in the snow and semi-dark to the park and were then greeted by the sight of the illuminated glass house and its large old industrial brick chimney. We were shown to our table and I had to marvel at how this old industrial site now felt warm, fresh and welcoming.The wine was a little expensive so we ordered the cheapest which was pleasant. Our pre-starters arrived, carrots and olives, an unusual mixture but they worked well together. The starters consisted of three slightly warm dishes presented together and we were advised to begin with the soup, followed by the scallop and finally the vegetables. Each dish was gorgeous, but then I started on a salad and I complained to my wife that some of my vegetables were bitter but we soon agreed that this was purposeful and worked because the flavours complemented and contrasted wonderfully between each mouthful. Our mains of fish were also very good but rather more conventional and our desserts and coffees completed our dining but there was more to come. We were offered a tour of the growing section of the glass house building and we had great fun examining the plant beds of pumpkins, tomatoes and rhubarb. We were even allowed to pick some vegetables to take away with us. The service at the table and on tour was exemplary throughout, we felt that they valued our custom.I would rate this place very highly and I will not come back to Amsterdam without visiting this place again. It was expensive, but it was also good value for an outstanding dining experience."
152649806,30,"February 20, 2013",Disappointing,We were really excited about this restaurant and maybe our expectations were way too high but as well travelled foodies we are up for a challenge! The restaurant is quite a way out of town and the restaurant emailed me instructions on how to get there which I applaud. We didn't realise tat you have to check in and out f the tram otherwise yr ticket for an hour is void so we had to pay twice & would have been cheaper to take a taxi.The restaurant is visible from a distance and the setting is lovely and so is the restaurant. I knew it was a set menu but thought there would be choices from set things on offer but no. 3 starters one being anchovies on toast with cauliflower purée we had to remove the anchovies as neither f us like them. Marinated raw fish with pickled vegetables would not have been on my list f favourites. Nor the very bland consommé which tasted of nothing. The presentation was good. The main course did not disappoint and was a beautiful piece of hake which was te best part of the meal. Wines are very expensive too and the staff were on the stand off-ish side and stood fro a whie chatting to each other and not serving anyone. all in all it was a disappointment for us and too expensive for what you actually received. The surroundings are lovely and it's very stylish and clean on the positive notes.

So after much researching I booked De Kas. From the moment we stepped off the tram in the snow and looked across the road and this beautiful building glowin in the park, I knew I'd made the right choice.We were greeted with such warmth and as I'd mentioned on booking that we were heading home the next day after five weeks in Europe, we were asked about home and how we'd enjoyed our trip. All of this was lovely and the setting is just amazing but the food was perfection. Its a degustation so probably not a lot of point reviewing what we had as its changed often."
151880765,50,"February 11, 2013",unmissable dining experience in Amsterdam,"My girlfriend and I dined here at the end of our stay in Amsterdam and couldn't recommend it more highly if you're looking for something special. The menu changes frequently to accommodate particular herbs, fruits and vegetables home-grown in the nursery. During our time garlic, chicory and rhubarb were used as ingredients in the restaurant's various dishes (not necessarily all at once!).The restaurant - a renovated greenhouse - was visually spectacular at night. The large, windowed hall was lit by a series of cool and unusual green and blue lights. The atmosphere of De Kas was definitely a highlight of our night and has no parallels in anything we had experienced before.The waitstaff were attentive and knowledgable and the food seasonal, fresh and thoughtful. We couldn't fault any aspect of the restaurant and look forward to returning."
151814857,50,"February 10, 2013",Another vegetarian's haven in Amsterdam,"I have been going to de Kas each season for the last ten years or more. Every season because their fare consists of the freshest seasonal produce, which they prepare in a new way each day. There is no a la carte menu card - just three courses for lunch and four for dinner. The ingredients are mostly/all organic - some herbs are grown in the greenhouse (de Kas means greenhouse in Dutch) Since they had a vegetarian patron for an extended period, although the restaurant caters for all sorts of food preferences, I, being a vegetarian, always get delighted. The ambience is very relaxed, in a renovated greenhouse, with a beautiful park surrounding it. The service is always friendly and quite informative. I suggest having matching wines for each course. Totally brilliant!"
151695173,50,"February 8, 2013",A special treat!,"What a treat to have made it to De Kas for our last meal in Amsterdam, which was lunch on a Monday. Will definitely be booking a dinner reservation for the chef's table on my next trip! As all the other reviewers mentioned, the grounds are absolutely gorgeous! It's just a magnificent restaurant and one-of-a-kind experience. Seating for lunch was outside on the patio by the herb garden area. It was a beautiful sunny day, and along with the gorgeous setting made De Kas one of the highlights of our trip to Amsterdam. Because I typically love sampling several dishes at restaurants, the downside for me is that they only offer a 1 option prix fixe menu (which I believe changes daily). It's not a big deal though because the meal was very lovely. The fish, vegetables, and all other ingredients were of highest quality and tasted so fresh and delicious. The lunch prix fixe was about 38 euros, on the high side for lunch, but definitely worth it for such a special treat."
151636373,50,"February 7, 2013",A Joy,"We enjoyed this restaurant from start to finish, they have everything just right, which believe me is not easy in a restaurant. From the minute you walk in the door you feel looked after and at ease. The no option menu I love, you just know everything is going to be fresh, which it was. They ask you have you any allergies or is there anything you don't eat, then the adventure begins......fantastic. Starters, a little cup of cauliflower soup, braised chciory with shavings of early rhubarb, a little shell of beautifully cooked shrimps and a scallop. Main course, confit of duck on sauerkraut, dessert, thin slices of blood orange, chocolate mousse and a crisp candied slice of blood orange, all dairy free and truly delicious. What more can I say."

Although there is only 1 menu, they take care to ask if there is anything you don't want / can't eat. The food was absolutely delicious. A bit expensive, but definitely worth it for the whole experience."

We booked the chef's table because we are foodies and had heard about this restaurant. We were not dissapointed. Each dish was creatied uniqely for us out of fresh and local ingredients by the chef or one of his assistants. They made a point of coming to our table and explaining the dish ad the thought that went into creating it. The chef even took us on a tour of grounds where they grow much of their food. The fresh ingredients and the pride in creating the perfect blend of flavors just for us made it a meal of a lifetime. Absolutely incredible!

From the moment I walked into the dining area I was blown away and knew it would be a night to remember. The waiter was extremely polite and knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant, owner and all ingredients used to prepare each dish. We were provided amazing olives, bread and celery salad to begin the courses, then a 3 small plates for the appetizer of the 3-course dinner. Each plate was phenomenal, my favorite being the veal tartare with a shallot tarte. For the main course, we had brill atop a spinach risotto with glazed carrots (best fish I’ve ever had) which was cooked to perfection! For dessert we has chocolate truffles with prune ice cream (at first this sounded questionable, but was actually very delicious) and citrus marmalade. After the meal, the head chef took us on a tour of the green house and kitchen which was AWESOME. Everyone at De Kas was a delight and provided the best dining experience I have ever had. Service like this is one in a million. I would highly recommend De Kas for anyone traveling to Amsterdam."

We came to this conclusion when we dined at Restaurant de Kas. Whereas all of the food was wonderfully prepared and the service above par, we are just not adventurous eaters. The meal started off with great wine (we payed for the wine pairing option). Appetizers were good until we got to the duck, which was so fresh (killed that morning on site) that the waiter noted that it might actually have buckshot in it). He wasn't joking.....That would set the tone for the remainder of the meal, much of which was food that could be described as a little odd. Keep in mind, as I noted above, perhaps we were just not cultured enough to eat at an establishment such as this......with its lack of menu and limited substitution options.My advice: just be sure that you are okay paying upwards of $200 on a dinner for two that could be a wildcard meal based on what is being served that particular evening."

The meat and fish and cheeses are all having a healthy reputation before they are allowed on your plate.

The restaurant has an attached greenhouse that grows various vegetables that are served daily at the market. The restaurant itself is located in a park fairly central to the town (10 minute cab ride Leidesplein square). It's a beautiful structure with high glass ceilings. The food and the service were very good. The waitstaff were both professional and very nice. They asked my son if he wanted to take a brief tour of the greenhouse and he and I really enjoyed it. The food was also really tasty. My wife had the venison, which was cooked to perfection, while my son and I had perch.My only criticism of the restaurant (and why I gave it a four rating instead of five) is the limited menu. Basically, they want to serve you what they have. While that is laudible to an extent, I want to be more in control of what I eat. They wanted to serve venison, which I usually do not like. The perch was a ""backup"". They don't even have menus.So, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for its food, service and ambience. Just recognize that the menu is limited so be prepared to ""take an adventure""."

As described in other reviews, the restaurant IS a greenhouse and you walk by the gardens where you food has grown as you walk to your table. I can't remember the exact amount but the dinner is a flat fee per person (maybe 50-55ish euros?) and then the chef just sends out a great combination of dishes out of what was made available from their farms that week. The service was impeccable as they take the time to describe each dish as it is brought out. Next time I am in Amsterdam, I am definitely headed back - I cannot wait!"

The chef picks as much as possible natural products (taste, texture, ...) and most of the vegetables and herbs are coming from their own garden (situated besides the terrace of the restaurant). Although the restaurant is big, you never get the feeling it becomes noisy, stressfull or they want to get you out as fast as possible. They take the time for you so that you are able to enjoy this gastronomic experience at its best !"

Aside from the aesthetic beauty of the building and the surrounding area, the food is sublime. Harvested that day from the gardens, Chef works without a menu and just cooks whatever is fresh. Frankly, I moaned my way through the meal. It was one of the best that I have had all year....and that is very high praise."
145689516,50,"November 18, 2012",Excellent Meal in interesting surroundings,"We went to the chiefs table but from looking around this is a very popular restaurant in the middle of a park a trams ride from the centre of Amsterdam. It manages to feel spacious and being a converted glasshouse (or greenhouse if you're from the UK) is light and roomy. The food is based on what's fresh and what is being grown at the farm 20 km outside the city. As a result there is no choice other than allowance for vegetarians and allergies. However, the food we had was delicious and the staff were very friendly and could not have made us feel more welcome. It even extended to an a cappella rendition of 'Moon river' from one of them who was a student from the Conservatorium van Amsterdam.A great selection of wines complemented the excellent dishes. Given the changing menu you could visit every week without getting bored. This is one place I will certainly have on my list for when I next go to Amsterdam."
145677927,50,"November 18, 2012",Conservatory dining,Got a taxi to this slightly off the track restaurant which is housed in a huge glass greenhouse style building. There's no menu - they just serve up what they've grown in the greenhouse and their field. We went for the wine pairing menu which is just 25 euros extra and the whole experience was exemplary. Every course was delicious and the service was perfect. The home grown giant green olives were amazing! If you are in Amsterdam you have to go to this restaurant.
145527258,50,"November 16, 2012",Delightful Gastronomic Experience,"I had the pleasure to have dinner in restaurant De Kas for my birthday in February. I was really pleased with the service and the food was really innovative and delicious. I like the concept of growing their own veggies, which gives the customer fresh dishes on the table. It would be nice to eat there in spring or summer when there's still daylight to enjoy more the actual greenhouse style with lights coming through."
145249062,50,"November 12, 2012","Service, setting and beautifully presented food","We went to De Kas for our wedding anniversary meal in August. Chose it simply because of the interesting write up in the guide book. So glad we did. Service was perfect, friendly and helpful but discreet. Food was delicious and beautifully presented. There is no menu choice, just the selection of the day. They will however, cater for any particular hates or intolerances - they made me a lovely tomato free starter. Lovely appetisers, selection of 3 starters, then delicious main and desert, coffee and sweets. We also chose to add a cheese course. Many ingredients are grown in the onsite greenhouses which you can walk through, or sourced locally where possible. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the wine list. The restaurant was very nicely set out with enough space between tables. Views from the windows onto the moat were lovely, green parrots flying through the trees! As the sun set, the lighting inside was lovely. A really great evening and good value. Have already booked to take the in-laws!"

144554704,30,"November 5, 2012","Beautiful Location, Great Service, Ultimately Disappointing","How much does the food matter to you?If you like a marvelous atmosphere, professional service and eating next to the place where much of your food was grown, and if you don't mind paying a premium for food that is pretty ho hum, De Kas is the place for you.Went for a business dinner with a group and got the special 99 Euro all inclusive meal. There were some nice ideas, but the ultimately De Kas succumbed to the flaw so many Dutch restaurants are prone to: it puts beauty and form over flavor. The food was bland, the portions were small, but it all looked great.Too much money for too little, mediocre food. The wine was great though."

142825016,50,"October 14, 2012","Some of the fanciest food I have ever eaten, beautful space. Love it!","This restaurant served some of the most uniquely prepared food that I have ever eaten. There were flower petals, little carved beets, stacked up and carved chocolate on the dessert, all kinds of special touches on everything.We had little shot glasses of foam soup as an amuse bouche. Then a little piece of salmon with caviar on a spoon. Then a gorgeous lobster claw and arm taken out of the shell and arranged with curls of cucumber and tiny smoked shrimp. Tiny multicolored beets carved and arranged on baby greens. On and on, each dish more Alice In Wonderland-like than the previous one.The space is a greenhouse with jellyfish-like glass lamps hung from the rafters. It is huge and open and possibly the coolest place I have ever eaten, except for a beach in the Maldives.I thought that this was the best restaurant that I visited in Amsterdam. I loved it and I highly recommend it."
142622332,50,"October 12, 2012",A MUST when in Amsterdam,"Our top chef Margot Jansen from South Africa said it was on her bucket list so we decided to visit and we were not disappointed. Chef Ronald Kunis is passionate about the seasonal fresh produce and ingredients he uses which contributes to a great menu. He took us on a conducted tour of the garden and we so enjoyed hearing about the different tomatoes, herbs etc which are grown there. De Kas is a renovated hothouse with a friendly, open look about it and the kitchen visible. Food combinations were exciting, different and delicious. I will be back. Be sure to book for evenings."
141889009,50,"October 3, 2012",Fabulous dining experience,"The setting is great - a greenhouse in a park flanked by a picturesque herb garden. Inside there is a working greenhouse which produced the cherry tomatoes served before the starters. The room is really uplifting to be in. Olive trees and glass. The menu is a basic three courses without the option of choice. Three yummy starers to share, a main course, monkfish, and a desert. The wine was very good and not overpriced. The overall experience was absolutely excellent."
141467702,50,"September 27, 2012",A unique gastronomic experience,"The setting is beautiful. A huge greenhouse in the middle of a park! From the moment you approach the glass building, you know this is a different experience. The room is bright, spacious and fresh, surrounded by the herb garden on one side, and another greenhouse where they were growing tomatoes, courgettes and eggplants - both worth a visit. The attitude of the staff is very relaxed and friendly, they give you all the time to relax, choose your drinks and absorb the place. You are then introduced to the menu and its ingredients. They are proud of their produce which is all local and most of it from their own gardens. De Kas offers a 3 course set menu of 3 starters, a main and a dessert. You can always add a cheese selection (The Dutch like their cheese!). Delicious modern hearty food. We loved it."
141121838,40,"September 24, 2012",Fantastic fresh food in a cool setting,"This is a true ""market cuisine"" restaurant which is located in an old green house on the corner of a park just outside the centre of Amsterdam (easy tram-ride or even easier taxi ride).

138174393,50,"August 23, 2012",Lovely unique setting,"If you want to try one of the most unusual restaurants you'll ever see/eat in, make a reservation here. Restaurant is very large-a part of a greenhouse-but yet feels cozy. You are invited to have yourdinner drinks outside in the back of the restaurant where there are more gardens. It is all very casual and relaxed-and jeans and shorts are fine. The menu is set at49.50 euros. The 3 appetizers served together are not huge but filling after the pre dinner huge, delicious olives and roasted beets. The entree this night was plaice which was good even though slightly overlooked. Dessert was a light and wonderful sherbet/custard/fruit compote. Since it is a set menu call in the am to ensure you can eat the food-if you don't like an item they will happily substitute another."
138129730,50,"August 23, 2012",Just fabulous,"A little out of the way from central Amsterdam, but definitely worth the cab ride. absolutely special in every way. Food, service, atmosphere.

136906186,50,"August 11, 2012",Wonderful Atmosphere and Great Food,"From the time you walk thru the greenhouse full of tomatoes and into the conservatory dining room you know you are in for a great evening of fresh home grown vegetables, wonderful and differently prepared meats, sumptuous dessert and attentive service. They are very good at accommodating any dietary restrictions. There is no menu but the food is plentiful enough and very innovative and to be enjoyed."
136831324,50,"August 10, 2012",Wonderful in every way.,"We (me and two business associates) had such a wonderful evening at De Kas that when I just looked it up on TripAdvisor to write a review it just hadn't even occurred to me that there could be negative reviews. Out of curiosity I read them all and basically didn't recognize any of the descriptions except maybe for the impressive bill because De Kas isn't cheap - and it shouldn't be.The location and grounds are simply stunning and very, very well kept.The staff all know what service is and maintain a great balance between formal and informal. We were served by a few different people and no matter who it was, they all knew to speak English to us because my two colleagues are English-speakers (I'm Dutch) - frankly that sometimes was rather impressive since I wouldn't have a faintest idea of the English words for all the vegetables, flowers, herbs and some typically Dutch delicacies.Because my wallet was stolen earlier that day my payment methods were slightly clumsy but they went out of their way to accomodate, very sweet.We were free to roam the greenhouse and garden in between courses, they would just wait until we were back at our table before proceeding with the next course.The food itself was simply delicious, very original, lush even, and more than enough.The restaurant was fully booked on your average Tuesday night, but still doesn't feel crowded. I saw businessmen, families with children, suits, jeans, tourists and locals - all equally comfortable.Will definitely again, because I want to at least try a sunny lunch outside and a stormy rainy dinner under the glass roof. See you soon."
136115801,40,"August 3, 2012",Locally grown vegetables in a unique atmosphere,"This was my second visit to De Kas and it confirmed my positive impression. Many others wrote about the unique location and concept (in a vast greenhouse, serving mostly locally produced ingredients), so I won't reiterate in detail.As we arrived at 19:40 (held up by a thunderstorm) the service at most tables was in full swing (The Netherlands are famous for dining early) and it took a while to place orders for drinks. Later on, we were treated with full attention and the service was personal and warm. With some trepidation we took the wine pairing they offered (this can go very wrong in some places), but we didn't regret it: the wines were well chosen, interesting, and at 25 EUR good value. Some small refills were not charged extra. A three-course menu (with optional cheese or dessert) is ca 50 EUR and represents good (but not outstanding) value. The menu is fixed, but one can veto certain ingredients.The strong point of the place are the fruit, herbs, and vegetables that are grown on the spot. Now in summer, their quality is outstanding. Luckily, they don't try to do too much with them and let the aromas speak for themselves. For vegetarians, the place is a treat. Bread seems to be home-made and tastes very good.Altogether, an enjoyable place that, due its special setup, will give a lasting memory of your visit. The place is very popular, reservation is essential."

It's a beautiful conservatory building (would be great for a party) with a lovely herb and flower garden out back. We were given wedges of sliced, dressed tomatoes (pulled from the conservatory about 50m from our table)-delightful..they tasted of ...tomatoes...very unlike those you buy in a supermarket! Fresh bread and huge Italian green olives completed the nibbles. No menu as such, just 3 starters to share among the two of us, highlighting their vegetables (grown in their farm outside Amsterdam) and served with edible flowers. Not totally vegetarian of course-our aubergine came with veal sweetbreads. Main was a perfectly cooked white fish, with moreish new potatoes and beans. My description not really doing it justice. All in all..a really great meal!"
134966304,40,"July 21, 2012",Know when to visit,We missed out on this experience. Hours are noon to 2 and 6 to closing. Walking in at 3 was bad. Great space and a fresh garden for vegisand herbs.
134956847,50,"July 20, 2012","A unique dining experience, one not to be missed","Our visit to Restaurant de Kas was fantastic and next time we're in Amsterdam (another city that feels like a place I must live at some point) we shall return.If you're considering a visit you'll probably know that the restaurant is the former old municipal greenhouse, and a big part of its usp is that the fresh ingredients that are served in the restaurant are grown on site or close by, with the menu being completely seasonal and changing once a week. With a glass of wine in hand we were given a tour of the site and got to see up close the different vegetables being grown, a really nice experience and it made the appreciation for our meal even greater.We dined at the chefs table and ate from the tasting menu, a collection of 9 courses with matched wines and our experience couldn't have been better - the unique concept, the food, the service, the atmosphere and interior were all fantastic.The kitchen in turning out so many covers on a busy Saturday night was as calm as could be, it was great to see them working together with such finesse and precision in producing such delicious food - it was a far cry from the kitchen nightmares we so often see on the TV here!The service was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly from everyone we met, and we were even given a bag of the Stilton and deep fried candied walnuts to take home as a gift from the kitchen guys. I think they thought us crazy English, sitting there ooohing and aaaahing over our meal and being verbally very appreciative rather than solemn and silent as many other folk must.For dish details and some other shots of our night at the beautiful and unique de Kas, please visit my blog - and then book your table, you won't regret it!http://thegourmetkitchen.co.uk/visits/2012/2/25/some-amsterdam-shenanigans.html"
134593012,50,"July 16, 2012",A unique dining experience,"First, they put a lemon basil leaf in my bubbly which I was skeptical about. But then I tried it. Then it grew on me. And the rest of the meal was just as surprising, refreshing and lovely. They even managed to make my sweetbread fritters exceptionally balanced."
134567496,40,"July 16, 2012","Delivers on the promise, but not to everybody's tastes","The interior and setting is really nice, unique in a way, very welcoming and the almost invisible but brilliant lighting is a masterpiece.The staff were ample and attentive, even if at times quite automatic in their courtesy. It felt more like a well-oiled top-notch fine dining machinery than being their guest, but then that's what you get extremely rarely those days. All staff on the floor on the day I was there were quite young, which might explain a bit, and there were a few negligible glitches and the lack of warmth due to stress.I have nothing against the idea of ""fresh set menu every day"", as a person who can never decide and likes to be (pleasantly) surprised, I am all for it actually. That said, there is always a risk of not hitting your sweet spot every time, and this was one of those times for me. I do not like overly spicy or otherwise intense food, and I enjoyed the mildness of all the dishes, but I have to echo some of the less positive comments here in that I found the food a bit too bland. It was mild, but not delicate, or intriguing. Everything tasted its best - the fish, the fresh vegetables, the meat - but there was nothing intriguing about it. I didn't leave feeling ""I've never had something like this before"".Oh and yes, the dessert was nothing to write home about (for me, at least), but I didn't mind, as the cheese board was the best ever, so I wouldn't mind no dessert at all after that (the dessert comes as a part of the set menu, the cheese board is extra, and you can see why - though by all means ask for it). The other highlight was the ""organic"" bread, both accompanying the starters and the one that came with the cheese board. As actual bread is hard to come by in the Nertherlands, the absolutely brilliant ones we got were the more of a rarity."
134457393,40,"July 15, 2012",Amazing & unique,"A wonderful restaurant in a great setting quite unlike anywhere else. The food is lovely, fresh,original and always a surprise as there is no menu to choose from, just the chefs choice of the day. We visited with our 4 month old baby and she was well received which is always nice. Service was ok...we had about 6 different waiters and by the last half of the night we were forgotten about which was a shame as overall this place is great."

132991008,50,"June 28, 2012",Spectacular setting for unique dining experience,"4 of us ate at De Kas 3 weeks ago and we were all extremely impressed-not only by the unique and beautifully imagined conversion of this former greenhouse into a cool, sophisticated setting, but by the wonderful food and the terrific service. Definitely worth the taxi ride since it's in a park on the outskirts of Amsterdam ."
132914654,50,"June 27, 2012",Highly Recommended!,"Going to this restaurant is a wonderful and total experience paricularly if you are lucky enough to go there for lunch on a day when the weather is perfect - like I did. As De Kas's main dining area is located in a large glasshouse, I imagine it would also be wonderful in the evening or in winter when it is snowing. It is a beautiful restaurant in a beautiful location. When the weather is perfect, lunched is served on the terrace overlooking the gardens and dinner is served inside and pre-dinner drinks can be enjoyed on the terrace.The service and food is also outstanding. You are nicely greeted on your arrival and promptly shown to your table. Within minutes you receive a complementary cob loaf of bread, some divine basil infused olive oil, plump fresh olives and marinated champignons. If you have not been to the restaurant before the wait staff also explain that there is a set menu and inquire if there is anything you do not eat or are allergic to so that the meal can be modified to your needs and requirements. You are also informed about the food coming from the restaurants' own onsite gardens and their nearby farm.On the day I went to De Kas the set menu included each person being served 3 different starters and a main meal. Desert, cheese, tea and coffee are additional costs but I did not have any of these as the meal was sufficent. There is a good varity of wines to choose from and you can purchase still or sparkling water. Guests can wander around the garden before or after their meal.The restaurant is so easy to get to as you simply catch Tram 9 and get off at the stop called ""Hogeweg"" and walk across the little bridge over the small canal. The tram actually gets you closer to the restaurant than a car or taxi could. This is a special restaurant that I could not speak highly enough about and would return without any hesitation if I am ever lucky enough to return to Amsterdam"

132519004,50,"June 22, 2012",Excellent food in a great setting...,"Amazing location with the greenhouses that some of their food comes from being situated next to the restaurant. Food was of the highest quality. Had the cheese as I'm not a dessert fan, but was very envious of the desserts that a colleague received."
132325674,30,"June 19, 2012",What's happening in that kitchen?,"We ate here for the second time in May 2012, the first time in August 2011. The first time was brilliant (five stars for the food, four for service), the tomatoes during our first course so gorgeously fresh (combined simply with diced parsley and olive oil) that I ate them like candy -- a great sign, considering I haven't had a great history with raw tomatoes.Our second visit was, ultimately, a dissapointment. The dishes, on the whole, lacked a sense of inspiration, and the quality from course to course and within courses was varied. The food of our first experience last year offered a clear sense of form, of wholeness, across the courses, whereas this most recent experience seemed slapdash, almost lazy, the combinations on the individual starter plates feeling incomplete and somewhat bland. And the size of my lamb for the main course was a bit meagre. I felt open to the experience but in the end didn't feel wowed on any level.Service was erratic. For most of the meal, staff seemed a bit too reserved and unavailable. After a cheese course, most of the other guests had left and so had some of the floor staff, while the remaining staff seemed to have forgotten about us. We asked about our dessert, and the floor manager apologised and brought us some Marotti Campi Xyris sparkling to say sorry, but I left with mixed feelings: It's a beautiful space, with unpredictable service and food.Next time we're in Amsterdam, I'll likely go back to Rijsel for dinner instead."
132183521,50,"June 17, 2012",Simply The Best,If you are visiting Amsterdam and looking for the ultimate hip dining experience then De Kas is for you. The restaurant has been created in the original Amsterdam greenhouse and is an architectural and interior design work of art in itself- throw in that the vegetables are all grown pretty much on site and any other ingredients are expertly chosen from top local and internationalsuppliers to provide a taste sensation you will long remember. The menu is created each day depending on the available ingredients and is a set fare. The service is faultless (and fabulously friendly)... and the food sublime. Make sure to book well in advance ....... you will not be disappointed!!
132147468,30,"June 17, 2012",Fresh food but bland.,"Beautiful restaurant with a great theme of using organic produce grown by the owner etc etc. All very noble but doesn't make up for the blandness of the food, I had expected more distinct flavours considering the origins of the raw materials. The olives were rubbery and too salty. I was served plaice on my visit that was cold when it arrived at the table and dare I say undercooked and sloppy. Wonderful atmosphere, lots of staff giving great service but I was underwhelmed."
132020019,50,"June 15, 2012",Great atmosphere,If you like organic and bio foods this restaurant is a must. It has a set menu of what's in season so you know the food is fresh. The service is unbelievable and the decor and building creates a real experience.
131979683,50,"June 14, 2012",Best meal in Amsterdam,"Your food can't get any fresher, being that the majority of what will be on your plate is grown right on the premises. Service was simply fantastic. Always someone paying close attention to your needs. Had a wonderful tasting menu, worth every penny. Fantastic wine list, as well. The interior design of the restaurant is what really stands out and gives this place the title of one of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. Chef Bas is a true artist."
131860973,30,"June 12, 2012","Unique place, average food","A place I would recommend everyone to visit, because of it´s location in a greenhouse in a park in the east of Amsterdam. Perfect for a date or o bigger group of friends or colleges. But what happened in the kitchen? The fish was rather tasteless, something ordinary in an extraordinary place."
131726250,40,"June 11, 2012","Great place, good food","We prebooked on our last night in Amsterdam. The scenery and the restaurant itself was fantastic. We loved the fact that they grow their own vegetables, or most of them. The retaurant is a bit noisy and its not easy to here what the waiters say. Some of them with very bad english. The dishes were beautiful with lot of fresh spieces, but still it lacked a little taste. All in all, this was a very good expreience, but not full score due to taste and lack of charm amongst the waiters."
131503730,40,"June 7, 2012",Greenhouse Luxury,One of the better restaurants in Amsterdam in unique location. Food was good not out of this world but the service and environment made it a lovely evening. I would recommend this restaurant in Spring or Summer.

The location is absolutely breath taking when the weather is nice- a greenhouse in the middle of a park. All organically grown veggies and locally procured meats and fish. The interior is beautiful. Service superb. But the food... could be better. I found the 3 starters at the last visit rather boring and almost tasteless. The meat dish was small slivers of veal tongue- tender but nothing special. The main was catfish which was not very exciting. Quite a change from the days when everything was delicious. The wine menu remains interesting especially if you wish to try the wine arrangement that comes with many surprises. If they could only get the kitchen right, it would be one of the top Amsterdam restaurants."
130220637,50,"May 19, 2012",Heavenly De Kas,"Beautiful food, beautiful staff, beautiful setting. As you get off the tram the area is a little shabby but in a moment you are in a tranquil and lovely park setting - in the middle sits De Kas - the old greenhouse which has been transformed into a most elegant, bright and stylish restaurant. The food is immaculately presented and as fresh as can be - based on masses of organic vegetables, herbs and flowers it is paradise for veggies or meat-eaters. We had the most mouth-watering and delicious Riesling @ 6 Euros a glass and the whole lunch was about 110 Euros for two - worth every penny. Staff are delightful and attentive. I would go to Amsterdam (from UK) just to eat here."
130093147,50,"May 17, 2012",Amazing food in a former greenhouse,"Restaurant De Kas is an amazing experience! Let's start with the location. The restuarant is a former greenhouse of the city of Amsterdam with fantastic light inside due to the glass roof and big windows. The evening sun gives a unique light and atmosphere inside. The interior is peaceful and stylish with clean lines and absolutely not overdone. Then the food: it is amazing! Most vegetables and herbs come from their own nursery (you can have a peak at it as well!), and the rest of the vegetables and meat from farms in Amsterdam area. You can really taste that NOTHING is from a jar of a supermarket chain: everything is pure! We were awarded with tomato jam, courgette flowers, marinated beetroot and other unique dishes. The ingredients and menu change from season to season - that's why there really is not a menu to be viewd before you go. You can either keep the dinner as a secret or the ever-so-helpful and friendly staff will tell you if you so wish. Speaking of which, the service is fantastic! Every single staff member is friendly, professional and helpful. Your table is being cleaned all the time and asked if everything is as you wish it would be but not an annoying way. You really can take your time and enjoy their amazing food without anyone interrupting your culinary experimenting. I definitely recommed to eat in De Kas if your budget allows (it is NOT cheap!) but whenever you can you should aboslutely reserve a table and enjoy an evening in this atmospheric restaurant. It is located outside the centre of Amsterdam but with an easy connection (tram 9) from city centre of Amsterdam."
129569926,50,"May 8, 2012",Eat here,"Amazing food, great service, perfect location. This isn't one to miss, you need to book well in advance. It was about 200 Euro's for a three course dinner, wine and service so not a cheap eats place but was one of the highlights of our trip.I'd love to go back one day."

It's housed in an old greenhouse and very popular with locals and business groups. Centered on organic and local food, the meal is determined by the chef. You advise of allergies or strong likes or dislikes and dietary restrictions and the chef does the rest. The appetizer was composed of three items and if the meal stopped there I would have been completely satisfied. So delicious! The vegetarian entre did not measure up to the appetizers, but seriously, the appetizers were so good I didn't care. The staff was terrific and even insisted on giving us a greenhouse tour before we left."

The greenhouse environment like many have mentioned made for a great evening.The food was delicious and the duck for the main course was cooked perfectly. The service was courteous and prompt.The desert was my favorite as it was a chocolate cake with rhubarb. Mmmm...I would imagine the summer months bring a wider variety of produce to use. This restaurant only uses things they grow or harvested locally.The food and service performed up to its reputation.

This was one of the most amazing restaurant venues I have ever seen. It is set in what is a former greenhouse complex, which lends itself to an amazing setting. If you can go whilst its still light out and stay when it gets dark you'll be treated to an excellent evening.The food is just as great. There isn't an ala carte menu, but instead they do a fixed menu that varies with the ingredient that they can get. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable on describing the dishes and recommending a wine pairing.Its worth the 10 minute cab ride to see this side of Amsterdam's culinary expertise!"

I did imagine that it might be lacking in atmosphere, but was pleasantly surprised. It doesn't have a warm and cosy feel, but lively instead. The food is a set menu, no choice, from there own gardens. Instantly able to offer a vegetarian menu, I didn't like the cold the poached egg, but my dining partner loved it so you take risk. Everything else was wonderful, carefully constructed an executed to a high standard. Service was good, quite inobtrusive which I like. Not the cheapest place but well worth it if you can stretch the budget"

EVER!,"We dined quite early at De Kas which made it all the more enjoyable as the menu was a complete surprise and we didn't see what other people were eating around us. We chose the wine pairing menu which was just amazing. The wines were top notch and did complement the food nicely. The quality of the ingredients shone through in each dish and the presentation and quantities were just right. The pudding was exquisite. the best venison I've ever eaten, everything about is was just brilliant! I also love the concept and the setting of the greenhouse. The service was excellent as well, really friendly and they provide a good explanation of the wines and the food that you're given. Loved it.It's also quite a romantic spot, I would say. Quite pricey though but worth the splash. :)"
126170028,50,"March 16, 2012",Everything was perfect!,"We enjoyed every aspect of our dinner here: the food was great (simply amazing how some of the vegetables tasted! and the deer was superb!), we choose the wine arrangement which matched the courses perfectly, the atmosphere was very nice (although a greenhouse is of course big and high place, the way the tables and other objects were arranged and the lights were designed made it almost cosy) and the service was good as well. We have been here twice and will certainly come back again!"

The setting is really nice, and the restaurant is beautifully design. We ate here on a relatively quiet evening. The service was friendly and competent. Given the emphasis on fresh vegetables, I expected those to be the highlight of the meal, but in fact the vegetable dishes were the biggest disappointment. The fish we were served was very well prepared and we both really enjoyed it. But the vegetables were overcooked, or cooked in a sauce or pastry which hid the true flavor. And besides the fish, everything was served cold (even the pastry vegetable dish), which is not really what one craves on a cold winter evening. Overall, we were pretty disappointed. By Amsterdam standards, this restaurant is quite expensive. I don't mind paying for great food. But this was not great - it was simply average (taking into account the fish was good and everything else was mediocre). Perhaps it would have been better in the summertime, but we won't be back to find out."
124702211,40,"February 17, 2012",I'll be back here.,"Nice place, with very good food. Staff is excellent, knows what they're serving and happy to answer questions.The location is quite nice, an old greenhouse.

I was offered to get a less sweet duck serving but was not in the mood of another surprise aflter a long cold dayWhile I can accept a fixed menu, I cannot undertand why they is no second choice on the main dish. irrespective of how convincing the staff tried to be... .When I arrived I though the price was fair.

THe atmosphere was fantastic and conveyed every moment that were eating food grown on site. We had food restrictions and the way in which we were acoomodated was mind blowing.This is not a drawback but a comment, I did feel that I was in a room of ""special occasions.""

I visited again 5 years ago and I was not very impressed, but I felt not so wonderful myself, so I blamed the lack of surprise on my cold.Last November friends invited us and now I know for sure: the food is okay, but not very special. Everything is supposed to be fresh (of course, what would one expect from an expensive restaurant) but the staff uses this so called freshness as an excuse to offer just one menu at a cost of nearly 100 euro per person.The fish was very bland and tepid, the meat was okay but not more than that. The starters were - as often is the case - the best part of the meal.The restaurant was crowded, al lot a tourists who read Tripadvisor I am afraid..For us, we live in Amsterdam, it has been our last visit to this overpriced restaurant."

The interior was well designed with soaring ceilings crisscrossed with subtle black matte painted industrial pipes, presumably for heating. They somehow managed an acoustic miracle, in that we were almost completely unaware of conversation other than our own.The staff was delightful in their courteous, professional and in my case compassionate service. I had been knocked to the ground my a hit & run bicyclist before entering the restaurant. The staff immediately helped to clean me up and provide a welcome ice pack for my injured head and continued to unobtrusively make sure that I was able to enjoy an otherwise delightful evening from start to finish. Yes, it was expensive, but so very worth it."

They serve one basic menu that varies daily but they do accommodate individual food allergies and preferences. The food is creative and interesting without veering into bizarre or experimental. Our servers were charming and the meal was served at a perfect pace (likely a consequence of the limited menu). The wine flight, for 25 euros, included champagne, a dry white German, red Barbara, German ice wine, and a lovely lambrusco style to finish. Our visit involved some unusual circumstances - my partner was knocked down by a bicyclist in front of the restaurant and the entire staff could not have been more compassionate or helpful.I enjoyed every bite and every minute at this lovely restaurant."
121563758,50,"December 9, 2011",A unique dining experience!,During recent visit to Amsterdam had the opportunity to dine here with collegues from work. Unique dining experience in which you pick the number of courses you want and let them know what you don't eat. The chef makes the choices. Nice surprise in not knowing what the next course will be. Food was very good. You can see the pride that goes into each dish. The kitchen is visable from most tables. Wine pairings for each course was excellent. Ambience good.
121262160,40,"November 30, 2011",Unique concept restaurant,"Restaurant in a large modern greenhouse, serving a fixed (no choice) menu of locally grown organic food.

120016683,50,"November 1, 2011",Taste buds tingling with flavour and joy,"It took me four days to get a table, but due to the excellent help, the resturant confirmed a table for two, a day before our arrival. I could see why we had trouble booking a table, as it was busy. That said, it should not detract from the excellent relaxed atmosphere of the location and the resturant team, who explained the dishes served. The food was well presented and had the taste buds tingling with flavour and joy. The whole team could not do enough for us. The building itself was unusual in a very nice way with lights leading to the main entrance, the resturant also called us a taxi. This is well worth a visit."

Couldn't have scripted a start to a romantic dinner any better. The restaurant itself is a modern gem. It is a remodeled old farm house. A huge tree sits in the middle of the restaurant with a full glass ceiling. Worth it on its own. It was a fixed menu, with champagne to start (with an edible flower from the grounds in the glass), and the first three courses were salads. My wife and I agreed they were the best salads we had in ages. Not many places you can go to will throw 3 salads on a fixed menu but the greens were so fresh (picked from the restaurant's greenhouse that day) I could have had two more courses. The beets with creme were especially good. 4th course was cooked perfectly with a chocolate dessert. Overall it is an extremely unique experience and we are privileged to have had the opportunity to dine there."

A fantastic setting with a real attention to detail and quality. The waiting staff were there to explain all the different courses, ingredients and wines (we had opted for the wine tasting menu) - and spoke fluent English as well!The menu is a fixed menu - set on the day dependent on produce - but they did accommodate a dish change for me (cant eat cockles!!) which was no problem at all.The food was excellent throughout, with the cheese course my favourite. If you go for the cheese, don't go for the port, try the 30 year old sherry they recommend with it - it was just fantastic, and has changed my opinion of how good sherry can be!!Overall, a top quality restaurant and dining experience.

Never had a problem with the service.......wine list is nice - decent mix of prices, plus some creative options.If you're in the area, it's well worth the trip (although a bit pricey)"

118495597,40,"September 23, 2011","Great food and experience, Holland's Flagship Restaurant","My girlfriend and I went to De Kas back in March & had a terrific experience. First of all if you want to experience De Kas make sure you make a reservation. I was staying at the Marriott and when I arranged a cab with the concierge, he seemed concerned that I did not have a reservation (I took care of this 3 weeks prior to my arrival in Amsterdam).The restaurant is located in a very nice park & the green house gives it a surreal type of experience. My girl and I took part in the wine sampling which was an excellent value. It's really nice to get a different wine paired with your dishes. The food was pretty good, really fresh vegetables and fresh meats. I remembered getting a cheese tray and one cheese was a French Goat Cheese that was WAY too strong for my liking, but everything else was really good.The staff were friendly and the majority of the customers were all Dutch. This seems like the type of restaurant Dutch people go to for special occasions. The Marriott concierge advised me it is Holland's Flagship Restaurant and truly Dutch.I'm really glad I experienced this restaurant and would recommend it. Since the dishes change daily & there is no set menu, you have to come here with an open mind for trying something new. The food and wine for two was great value as well (around 200Euro). Great experience & I will go back the next time I make it to the Dam."

And I am so very glad we did! Restaurant De Kas is a stunning greenhouse conservatory, converted into an equally stunning restaurant. I so wish I had been there the night before when a huge rainstorm blew in. Rain pounding on the glass roof would have been a sight to see! They service a Prix Fix menu, with consideration taken for your likes, dislikes, limitations, etc. We just told them to bring it on, and they certainly did! Lovingly prepared from start to finish, all the dishes featured fruits and vegetables either gown in-house or locally. And all other components of our dishes were sourced locally. They were even so kind a to offer the recipe (yippee) for the basil ice cream that I raved about. A nice touch. Really, a don't-miss experience for travelers to Amsterdam. If you are a foodie, you will be in heaven!"

Although De Kas is more modest in its ambition than a place like Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester, New York, it is a very satisfying eating experience. We opted for the wine pairings, and the choices in all cases were unexpected and absolutely perfect accompaniment to the dish. The bread was a treat, flavorful and crusty. Our only quibble is their insistence on bringing all three starter dishes out at once. One couldn't help but feel that the ones we weren't eating were getting cold, and it was hard to resist rushing through to get them all. We loved the changing light as the night came on through the glass, watching the full moon. Despite the size of the room and the number of diners, it never got too noisy. We thought the vegetables were bursting with flavor, and the guinea hen served with smashed potatoes, orange reduction and roasted tomatoes was delightful."

Maybe a dessert included in the price would do. Let the well trained personnel explain their philosophy, and enjoy the dinner as we did!"

The food was interesting and extremely well done, but it was the exceptional and gracious service that was a shock. We've not had the greatest service during this 3-week European excursion, but de Kas was brilliant.

Set in a quiet park with storks nesting atop what was once a smokestack, De Kas is a world away from the city and a perfect place to enjoy wonderfully prepared fresh, local food. Service was outstanding and prices were quite reasonable given the extraordinary meals we experienced."
115911969,50,"July 28, 2011",a perfect evening,"This was our 4th visit to De Kas. Every meal has been outstanding and quite a treat. I will admit the first three times the dessert was a disappointment, (we are chocolate lovers, and there was no chocolate!) but this last time even the dessert hit the mark. this is a highly recommended destination. And if you ride your bike to get there, you get to work off the meal once you are finished. I also recommend getting there early and taking time to enjoy the surrounding park."

Want a dining experience you have never had before.....I'm all 3 and this place delivers all 3...very well. They grow their own herbs, vegetables, and flowers in the adjoining buildings....I can't believe I ate flowers tonight!!!! Their dinner menu is a 3 course meal with whatever is in season and whatever they are growing at the time and have fresh and ready. They actually have a winelist (at a reasonable price) that goes with the meal....that was fantastic as well. The entire meal was the best I've had in ages. The main course of Place fish was remarkable. Highly recommend if your in Amsterdam. The location in obscured park (off the street) that once you find is a beautiful setting. Call ahead for reservations as I can imagine it gets packed on the weekend. I went on a Wed night and it was packed. If you are going to splurge this is a great value for splurging...I spent about $85 euro (including tip) whereas I spent $130 Euro at a comparable place that wasn't as good."
115762752,40,"July 25, 2011",An Amsterdam modern original,"The setting is beautiful: a greenhouse in the middle of a park, and they serve vegetables grown in their own garden next door (we always visit it). There is a set menu of good quality, but it seems not all reviewers were as pleased as we were on the several times we've been there. Service is good, for Dutch standards (which are not as high as you will find in other parts of the world). We usually take friends who are visiting Amsterdam, and we consider it among the city's top ten places."
115730134,50,"July 24, 2011",Everything top notch!,"This is one of the best restaurants in Europe in my opinion and one of the fine examples of Dutch innovation and creativity. The food was so inventive and the flavour and texture combinations a complete work of art. We let our wait staff - completely professional - choose our wine for us to match the dishes because we did not know what we were going to be served. They made fabulous choices for us. The atmosphere, tables, lighting, use of space is brilliantly conceived. Bravo to the creative genius behind this superb restaurant."

Took us about 20 minutes."
114990645,50,"July 3, 2011","Seasonal food, great service, pleasant atmosphere, expensive","De Kas offers a ""surprise"" menu -- what the chef thinks is fresh that day from its own greenhouse and gardens, and organic suppliers. They will adjust for food preferences, allergies, etc. so don't worry about the surprise aspect. Extremely pleasant atmosphere (in a park), very polished service (a nearby table knocked over their wine and the response was swift but gracious). The prix fixe dinner at 49.50 euros was for 3 starters, an entree, and a dessert. Wine extra. A special occasion restaurant. Perhaps the value was not as high as for a place half as expensive but the restaurant is definitely someplace special."

113983771,30,"June 17, 2011","I really wanted to love De Kas, but...","...I'm afraid it was all style over substance. Setting - awesome. Growing their own - brilliant. But the service was sketchy (due to inexperience I guess - even the front of house looked little more than a teenager) and the food... well it just wasn't good enough. The starters was rushed out before we'd barely had time to take our [wet] coats off. 2 out of the 3 were bland/underseasoned. We then waited nearly an hour for our main courses (quite how I'm not sure when they are churning out the same dish to everyone?!). Again, this turned out to be bland/underseaoned and this time, cold to boot. I would still recommend De Kas - as a concept it's fab and we could have just been unlucky and gone on an off night. But I'm still scratching my head now as to how food so fresh could taste of nothing when it is being grown right there on the premises. Hmmm...."
113597728,40,"June 15, 2011",Fantastic setting but food needs more flavour!,This restaurant is in a perfect setting and the concept of eating food grown in their own garden is great. The service was good to start but as the night dropped off it really fell away which was disappointing. The food we had was all nice but really lacked flavour which really let the entire evening down. I would still recommend going as it has so much potential and maybe we just had an average night but for a set menu all meals should be hot fresh and flavoursome.......... This should be a 5 star restaurant if done well....

Timing was a bit off; it felt initially as though the kitchen were serving the complete seating but they turned that around. It's not the easiest place to get to on public transport from the center - -best to take a taxi. The meal included some amazing duck and super-fresh delicious vegetables. We loved the farm tomatoes and olives out on the terrace with a drink before dinner -- absolutely lovely view."
111400855,50,"June 4, 2011",Impeccable! Excellent food in a glorious setting!,"This must surely be one of the best - if not the best - restaurants in Amsterdam. There is no menu. The food is chosen by the chef according to what is in season and looks best in the restaurant's greenhouse. We had three starters, comprising delicious, innovative salads, followed by excellent asparagus as a main, and then pudding. All accompanied with a well chosen wine selection.The staff were charming and informative. The setting is a greenhouse and in fine weather you can (as we did) sit outside and enjoy the sun and the gardens. Not to be missed."
111040196,20,"June 1, 2011",Have you ever heard of spices?,"I must confess I was disappointed with De Kas. With all the hoopla from some of my fellow reviewers, I was expecting something amazing. Bottom line is the food was boring. I did not notice any interesting flavors. In fact, it seemed like they forgot to finish the food prep. There was no noticeable spices on most of the food. We had a salad of greens that came with the vegetarian main course that had a tiny amount of some white liquid ""dressing"" on it that had no flavor at all. The main course consisted of 5 asparagus spears (3 large white, 2 smaller green) with what appeared to be a glob of mayonnaise on top, mixed greens underneath, and some peas. Although you could taste all the ingredients well, there was nothing interesting about it. My Mom could have cooked it. There was also a scoop of mashed potatoes, with some bacon fat mixed in to them that were tasty. The three courses of starters had one tasty bit, a tempura lobster tail, however again this fell short, it would have been far better with some kind of sauce / dressing to enhance the flavors. Overall I must say it was a big disappointment, especially for the price. Never again."

We were made to feel as special as the day was... from incredibly attentive service to a special dessert plate with ""Congratulations"" written in chocolate (in a totally non-tacky way!)We chose the works - apperatif of Moet, then a 5 course dinner selected by the chef from what was fresh that day (you are in a greenhouse after all) - we also chose to have the accompaning wine selection too - finishng with a chilled sparkling red to accompany dessert! From start to finish the experience (because that is what it is - not just a meal) was incredible. Cannot fault a thing.

We were served freshly baked bread, olives and some delicious roasted carrots. We were brought three starters to share. then a main course and a selction of desserts. The food and service was fantastic and we were also treated to an impromptu tour of the kitchen and a chat to the chef. This is not to be missed..Before we left the waitress asked if we would a photgraph taken in the Greenhouse where they grow som eof the produce. This is probably one of the best restaurants for food and service that we have eaten in."

It's quite nice to sit down and your order is already taken with the daily menu.
104723480,50,"April 19, 2011",Perfect,"This was my first time in Amsterdam. My college found De Kas on the internet. We spend a lovely spring evening there for a business dinner party of 20 people. Walking through the green-house gives you high expectations to the food. There was fantastic smell from all the fresh herbs. The restaurant has a fixed menu that is chanced daily – and we were not disappointed, meal was extraordinary. I tasted combinations of vegetables and spices I have never had before. The starter was creeps stuffed with spinach with a slightly taste of lemon – whauu that was great! The main cause was fish – perfectly fried. It was accompanied by the most surprising salad with a combination of chopped eggs and fresh flowers. Everything was served very delicate – unfortunately I did not take any photos of the food – but every plate was a little artwork of color, smell and taste. The staff had their attention on our table all time and no-one ever lacked wine or anything. I have no complains at all from this very nice evening, and it was not even expensive. De Kas is now “a must visit” in Amsterdam.Would recommend it to anyone both for a business dinner and for a romantic dinner for two."
104122210,50,"April 15, 2011",The very best,"De Kas (where we've been once before) truly lived up to expectations. We were entertaining for business purposes (14 people) yet we felt only intimate service and fantastic food.

103890969,40,"April 13, 2011",fantastic,a fantastic experience - the food is VERY good matched only by the service. Excellent and varied wine cellar although rather expensive. The De Kas experience is a definate `must do` whilst in Amsterdam.The restaurant is a tram ride out of the centre but the tram system is easy to use.Be prepared to spend a lot of money if you want the whole De Kas `experience`.The staff are very very nice people - approachable and amenable.We would definately recommend it

The food is delicious and fresh and I love the element of surprise (the menu changes daily). The staff were attentive and knowledgable and the atmosphere in the restaurant is relaxed but vibrant at the same time.We had a fabulous night there and would highly recommend it to anyone. My one suggestion is to not eat too much in the day before you go becuase you get served plenty of food on the night.For a restaurant of this calibre, we found it to be great value and will definitely be returning to De Kas when we're next in Amsterdam."
99583730,50,"March 9, 2011",Best Meal of Vacation,"We ate at some pretty fabulous restaurants while on vacation here in Amsterdam (and we dine out regularly in top restaurants around the world, for that matter). I chose De Kas based on reviews and the website, looking for an alternative experience to the status quo and an actual green vegetable while on the road. We were not disappointed. The food just felt fresh, beyond the simple and spectacular taste. In attendance was a college student who does not eat vegetables. The comment of the night was ""I'd eat more vegetables if they tasted like this."" I thought it was unique that the starters were presented ""family style"", each on a single plate all at once, and one was able to choose how much food was to be on one's plate. We did the wine pairings with dinner, and the sommelier was invaluable, refilling our glasses (with the most remarkable wines) at no charge, and paying special attention to the level of our water glasses. The comment by another reviewer about feeling like being ""in a gymnasium"" was totally off-base. The point was to feel like you were in a greenhouse yourself, witnessing the simplicity and elegance of natural food and, who knows, maybe experiencing plant life personified. Four of us dined and drank for about 400 USD which I felt was well worth the money. I had promised a dining companion I would not review this restaurant, for fear of drawing too much attention to it (most patrons, it appeared, were local--not an American in sight). However, we just had the most enjoyable experience, and I would certainly return in the future and can't help but recommend it to others."
99377216,50,"March 8, 2011",The perfect Surprise,"I booked the Chef's Table as a suprise for my boyfriends birthday.We we were warmly welcomed and given a glass of champagne on arrival with edible flowers, olives (beautiful, i had never liked them before), mushrooms a fresh loaf.We watched the kitchen and all the chef's run like clockwork presenting dish after dish of sublime food fresh from their organic farm. The menu changes every week to give their regular's a different experience each time they dine. At the Chef's table we had 8 courses, each with a different wine to compliment the dish, a different chef presented and explained each course to us. Our waiter who looked after us for the whole night treated us as if we were the only two in the otherwise very busy restaurant. The atmosphere was romantic and calm, despite being sat in the kitchen!The service incomparible, everyone so accomodating and attentive to your every need. A tour after the meal by our waiter and the opportunity to sit in the main restaurant for desert to gain another perspective. Entering the restaurant you have to walk across a long plattoon over a park lake lit up with lanterns - so pretty.A MUST if you are visiting Amsterdam and especially if you want to treat someone special to something special (and yourself!)There are other menu options that aren't as expensive as ours was to be at the chef's table but if you can afford it, it is well worth it and i would say quite reasonable for the night you will enjoy.(the price i have input below is inclusive of everything, wine, champagne, desert, tour, but not tax or tip)"
94489006,50,"January 26, 2011","Not just a restaurant, but an experience","We went here after reading the reviews on TA, and were not disappointed. It was a such unique dining experience for me. I really enjoyed the fact that you don't choose what you eat, the dishes get brought out to you and explained what they are at the tabel (they do ask if there's anything you don't like first). We were served fish for both our starter and main which was cooked perfectly, I've never had fish literally cooked to perfection. It was a delicious meal even though it probably wouldn't have been what I'd choose myself. Very happy tum tums :)"

92376049,50,"January 10, 2011","Great food, great service, great experience!","Would fully recomend going here if in Amsterdam. It is defintiely something different to experience.The food was excellent. We just went with the chef daily menu and it was very very good. There was bread on the table on arrival, fresh brown bread - very nice. then for starters there was 3 seperate things, one of them being oysters which neither me nor my girlfriend wanted so they changed no problem and gave me a chicken starter and my partner a vegitarian starter to accompany our other two starters each (a lot of food). The staff were brilliant. Very nice and friendly and also very helpful and informative regarding the food.The food really was excellent, we both got a salmon main course and it was presented excellently and also tasted very good. It came with little potatoe cheesy croquettes which were devine. But the overall experience of the place, being on a kind of farm and in a greenhouse and the friendliness of helpfullness of the staff all combined to make this a brilliant and beautiful dining experience. Would definitely recomend it to anyone.Very romantic and very different but good different. Fantastic place. As regards cost, well we had 2 gin and tonics, 2 bottles of white wine. 2 Sets of starters (3 things each), 2 main courses, 2 coffees and it came to 157 so its not overly expensive given all we got (2 bottles of wine being about 50 euro). Well worth it and is a bit special really."

85886782,40,"November 3, 2010",Good food in a converted greenhouse,"I have now been twice to De Kas, and both times, I have found the service excellent and the food pretty good, in a town not really noted for fine dining. The main restaurant is at one end of a largish greenhouse complex, with visible plumbing for the ventilation of the complex. However, in a strange way, this adds to the spartan elegance of the place and it is quite different in this respect. One can wander around the other parts of the greenhouse where herbs and some vegetables are grown for use in the restaurant, although when pressed, they would admit that the produce also comes from other wholly organic greenhouses elsewhere.The food is good, fresh, organic and while interesting, it is not spectacular to the point where I would want to come every month or so. There is only available a daily set menu but they tend to bring 2 or 3 of the dishes together at once so the 5 dishes on offer translate to a more normal 3-course menu. This is a brave restaurant as they offer only what they feel like the best produce they can get on the day and so your dining choices are fixed before you even come. If you are a fussy eater, then I recommend you telephone before dinner and ask for the dishes on offer that day. One time I had quail and the other time it was fish. Both times the food was cooked well, but rather simply, which did let the freshness of the ingredients speak for themselves. Personally, I would have preferred a little more finesse in the kitchen but my (Dutch) partners really loved the simpleness of the cooking so I am a little bemused.The wines on offer are good, with a wide selection from both old and new world wines. Service is friendly, professional and unobstrusive. Finding the place by walking from where I was staying in Rivierenbuurt was not easy, especially the first time, as one had to cross a little bridge into a park before coming to the buildings.However, it is definitely one Amsterdam experience to enjoy and there is a certain Dutch-ness to the spartan, simple but elegant approach which is appealing, perhaps more to some people than others."
85596401,50,"November 1, 2010",Only one set menu per night but worth taking the risk,"The fact that they only serve one set menu per night almost had us not go there. We would have missed out on a great experience. The De Kas occupies an old greenhouse in a park in Amsterdam and it is beautifully illuminated at night. Good wine list with a sommelier who knows his business. Great service, very attentive yet discret. The motto of the cuisine is that the veggies they serve were plucked the same day - and you can tell that the produce is super fresh."
84603164,50,"October 24, 2010","Excellent dining, atmosphere....well just excellent","We read about De Kas in some magazine back home and decided to try it. We made our reservation online which works perfectly nice. We took public transportation to the restaurant but would recommend a taxi - its a long walk and the location is of the touristmap, but now we have tried the trams :-) We were greeted by our hostess who took our coats and escorted us to a very nice table for four. The chairs were very comfortable and the entire setting very appealing and charming. The restaurant is actually a very big greenhouse and the restaurant grows all their own vegetables as the waitress explained. There's only one menu so the choice was only if we wanted the wine taster menu as well. We did - except for our children of 12 and 14.We were there a bit early - 19.00, but soon the restaurant actually filled up and this was a monday - but they are always full so order ahead. And this was the only minus - the waiters were really busy and the wait was a bit long between the 5 super dishes, but they were always smiling and nice to us. But back to the dinner.The food was absolutely super - both exciting and pleasing and we can absolutely recommend it....and compared to CPH prizes it was absolutely fair. We had the champagne for starters, 5 course menus, wine tasters, wine in between and the cheese platter also and all in all it was 330 euros - absolutely worth it :-)Please note that there are several seating possibilities - from the restaurant were we were seated to the bar and the chefs table - all with charming features"
84103469,40,"October 19, 2010","Very Neat Concept, Great Food!","After reading all the good reviews, my husband and I wanted to eat at De Kas for his birthday dinner, but even trying to make reservations a week in advance, they were already booked for all 3 nights we were going to be in Amsterdam. So we settled for lunch and were very glad to made the trip to the outskirts of town. (It's about 20 minutes by tram- no need to take your car either as there's no parking since the restaurant is set in the middle of a park). Located in an old glass greenhouse, the atmosphere is just great- very light and airy. The whole idea behind the restaurant is just neat- everything they cook, they've grown (meat and seafood come from local farmer partners). You can even wander through the greenhouse while you're there. There's no menu- each week, the chefs pick which ingredients they'll be using for the next 7 days. When you sit down, the server asks if you have any allergies or specific foods you don't like- past that, it's up to the chefs! You're then served 4 course (5 if you go for dinner). The food is delicious- very fresh, beautifully presented. That being said, I do believe that the food itself is a bit overrated- it's good, but not amazing. Plus, you're somewhat 'up a creek' if something comes out that you forgot to mention you didn't like. Case in point, my main course ended up being grilled lamb, which I strongly dislike...The set prices (39 euro for lunch, 49 for dinner) is steep for what you actually get, especially considering that alcohol isn't included. The waitstaff is great- very friendly, very attentive. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at De Kas. It's definitely worth a trip for the unique experience alone!"
83386458,50,"October 13, 2010","Quiet, romantic, elegant","As this was our one date night on a family trip to Europe, we pored over our guidebooks to find the perfect spot. We were looking for an elegant, tasty meal at a less-touristed restaurant, and we wanted to avoid stuffiness or formality. De Kas totally fit the bill!The restaurant is in the formal municipal greenhouse of Amsterdam. As it was summer, the room was filled with light. Since the emphasis was on ingredients, grown both on site and out on the restaurant's farm, the preparations were rather simple. The ingredients themselves were fresh and full of flavor, and so the meal was a terrific success. Next time I'm in Amsterdam, I would not hesitate to go there."
82185312,50,"October 5, 2010",Chefs Table is a bargain!,"I made a booking after reading reviews on trip advisor. It really was a dining experience rather than just another restaurant meal. I chose the Chefs Table option, which was fantastic. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were escorted to the kitchen and sat at a table to the side with a view of all the action. We were introduced to the head chef, who presented us with each of the courses and explained each dish in detail. We also had what seemed like exclusive attention of the sommelier, who explained why she had matched each wine to each course. After the the first two starters, the pasta course, the fish course and the main course of guinea fowl, we were given a tour by the head chef and shown where our asparagus had been picked from for one of our starters! We completed the evening seated at a nice private table in the main restaurant, for cheese, sherry, sweets,desert wine, cognac and coffee all included in the 125.00 euros a head.Bearing in mind that we both had a glass of champagne upon arrival, and 4 bottles of wine were presnted during the meal, along with the sherry,desert wine and cognac, the drinks bill would have run to more than the 250 euros at any other place we have eaten at in the last few years!Bargain!"
80465386,50,"September 21, 2010",Possibly the best restaurant I have ever been to,"De Kas is quite possibly one of my top restaurants ever (which is saying a lot). It was very, very good. Set in the middle of a park, it is housed in a huge glasshouse, with its own greenhouse where the chefs pick the ingredients freshly for your meal. No menus - they ask you if there's anything you don't like, and then they deliver what's fresh. Wonderful service, spectacular food, and our desserts had 'happy anniversary' piped onto them in chocolate. A proper occasion restaurant, and a delightful treat. The price was perfectly reasonable for the quality of the food ad experience. In fact I was so intent on lingering over dessert that we very nearly missed our train."

Staff were friendly, and ambience was really great. The food was very good - set menu for about €50 per head I think was value for the quality."

It was a special occasion so we booked the chefs table which is located inside the kitchen, where you can watch the chef and sous-chefs preparing all the food. As almost the whole kitchen and restaurant is a glass structure, the chefs table is surprisingly and refreshingly airy. For a set (steep but 100% worth it) price you get to try most of what they prepare and accompany it with several wines which change depending on what you are eating.

Nothing extravagant, straightforward cookery with fresh ingredients. The main entree was duck, again well prepared with fresh ingredients but not inspired by any means.This was a Wednesday night and we had a 7:30 reservation. We were seated at the edge of the restaurant next to the bar. The place was nearly empty except what looked like a corporate get together in a back room, and two couples seated next to us. My husband thought the place reminded him of a high school gymnasium, complete with echoes from noise in the kitchen and the sound of wait staff shoes on the hard surface floor. The center of the room is set up like a grade school lunch room with long rows of tables down the center.We had one bottle of wine, moderately priced, and three beers. The bill was $400.00 USD. I don't mind paying for great food, service, and atmosphere. But as my title said, it was good-like your mum's fried chicken and mashed potatoes, but not what I would call gourmet, or even particularly special. The dessert was a confused pairing of rhubarb sorbet, a lemon like pudding, all over a bit of cake. Surprisingly unmemorable."

A glass-house restaurant with no menu - only what's available from the gardens and local environs today. Even anyone who does not like vegies will be a convert - it's organic but not vego so even carnivores will adore this place. If the owner is about, ask him for his story. A group of us had a wonderful lunch there in March and heard his story. We had many good meals over two weeks traveling but all agree that this was the stand-out in terms of sights, sounds, smell and taste ...all brought together with the story of the place! To support something local and global (minimum impact to the planet), De Kas is a place not to be missed on the itinerary!"

The prices are thereafter, but it's worth it for special occasions.Most of their ingredients are locally sourced, some even grown on site. They have a good wine list too.One of the best restaurants in the city."
55185648,50,"February 4, 2010",delicious!,"The setting is gorgeous - under the stars in a glass ""greenhouse"" and reflects the restaurant's style - only fresh local food. The service was attentive without being overbearing. The food was DELICIOUS. There is no menu - you are served what the kitchen made based on what is fresh (with options to opt out based on dislikes and allergies)! Everything is great. Great wine list too!"
53881540,50,"January 19, 2010","Great food, great service, wonderful service","Eating at De Kas was one of the highlights of our holiday. As far as I remember, the owner is/ was a small farmer. He always wanted to open a restaurant and when this greenhouse came up for sale he took his chance.On arrival at the restaurant you are greeted warmly and shown to your table- your coats are taken at the door and your table no. put on the hanger so they hand them to you again when leaving.The menu is set- with no choice- and is prepared based on what has been harvested that day/week. I was a bit apprehensive at this but you are asked on arrival if you have any food allergies or dislikes, which are no problem. Probably no harm to mention these when booking either. There are 3 courses. The starter is actually a selection of 3 starters- each one nicer than the next. Our main course was pheasant- which I'd never had- but was gorgeous. Dessert was poached pear with chocolate and custard served in glass- very light after the substantial main course.The service here was impeccable but not overbearing- just right. You also felt that you could have stayed at your table all night- we spent ages over coffee and didn't feel rused at all.On leaving the owner saw us out, asked us how our evening had been, got our coats, and invited us to take freshly picked apples from a basket at the door- a really lovely touch.All in all a great experience and worth it for a treat."
51946884,30,"December 27, 2009",Serving at it´s best - cooking without edge!,"We had high expectations on De Kas, we read about it and heard people talking very good about it. I´m sorry to say that we don´t agree. The atmosphere is outstanding, the dining room is very nice and service is almost Michelin standard. When they don´t forget you... Which happened twice. But we had seven (7) waiters pouring wine, serving dishes, explaining taste combinations, laying out cutlery, pouring water.... and the restaurant was full! So over all very good service!If service was smooth and elegant the food was the contrary - rough and tough! A bit too rough! The head chef -who came out to talk to us after I complained about a dry and boring dish with pheasent - said that their cooking style is rough and uncomplicated and that they try to cook in a way that the dishes are going to please as many as possible! Like the warm oyster. The idea is that more people are likely to eat a cooked oyster than a raw one. Well, it doesn´t taste like a delicate oyster anymore, does it!? One of the starters was a combo of beetroots served with a mushroom, probably grown near if not inside a horse stable. It litterally tasted what a horse smells! When talking to the head chef about it he said ´we taste everything and we haven´t noticed anything wrong with the mushroom´!But we also had a few good dishes. Like the wild salmon, delicious. And a very mature cheese with an apple syrup and finally a apple compote with Zabaionne and chocolate ice cream!Over all: we had a good evening but we´re not recomending you making a reservation at De Kas."

The meal had a Christmas feel to it this week which was fun but didnt detract at all from the fabulous food. As a fussy eater, De Kas are always able to create something that suits me if I don't like the produce on the planned meal. .The flavours are magnificnet and the carrot oil this week was intense, flavoursome and really unusual.The concept is great, and the food worth making the journey for"
50224569,40,"November 28, 2009",Delicious food in a unique location.,"Bedankt to De Kas for providing such a unique setting for dining! It is is lovely, light and airy. My favorite part of the restaurant experience was not the food -- although the it was delicious and the presentation was beautiful -- but the pale blue glass water tumbler. The rest of the crystal was clear and the blue was perfection, particularly since it matched the sky on the bright clear October day we were there. The whole place just sparkled in the sunlight.First course was tappas -- large Italian green olives, marinated zucchini with mustard seeds, and a crusty round of bread with olive oil for dipping,.There were three starters for a prix fixe -- meat, fish, and vegetarian. The meat starter was a small tender piece of veal topped with gratinee and a leaf of brussel sprout. It was sitting on a bed of finely shaved chard and served with Hollandaise sauce. The vegetarian starter was gnocchi with dill sauce accompanied by rugula, almonds and cucumbers. The fish starter was two large scallops accompanied by pumpkin puree and topped with parsley.Then came the entree -- oven-baked Halliburt graced with French style green beans and beetroot. The hallibut rested on a best of lentils in a cream sauce and was accompanied by a turnip and rugula salad.We opted out of the sweet for dessert and instead shared a cheese plate with Spanish Cabrioles (blue), French muenster, and Holland cow cheese from Utrecht. It came with an apple/pear fruit syrup (stroop in Dutch), candied walnuts, and fig and walnut black bread.All I can say in YUM, YUM!P.S. I was taken there as a birthday treat so I do not know the cost of our lunch with a bottle of wine that day."
44185834,30,"September 24, 2009",Off the beaten track,"This restaurant is good for people with organic food habits! It is off the beaten track, in a hothouse. It is trendy, and serves a daily menu, where you don't choose. Food is cooked with mostly own vegetables. It is fun, but I would go there only once, for the experience..."
40709153,50,"September 10, 2009",Wonderful fresh food,"This was one of the best dining experiences I have had in years. The food was so fresh, so well prepared and so delicious. They only have a set menu which means you get tremendous value for money so long as you have a taste for most things. The setting is incredible. I' recommend lunch so you can see the gardens etc."
39848047,50,"September 5, 2009",Best restaurant visit NL 2009,"This was my best restaurant visit in the Netherlands so far in 2009. The location in a glass house a bit away from the street is unique (you have to know that is slightly remote to actually find it I think). Food really good. We went for full diner menu as well as wine menu. Very delicious and interesting combinations - they managed to fine the wine, which proved a perfect match for each dish. Waiters were on top of it. So full when we left! If you want a real nice restauant visit in Amsterdam, that is the place to go!"
38336361,50,"August 21, 2009",Cracking Kas!,"It has been a couple of years since I was last at De Kas so I jumped at the opportunity to try it again this week – and I had forgotten how incredibly tasty fresh food is!The set 3 course menu (with cheese platter as an optional fourth) was full of inventive ideas and mixtures of tastes that made every mouthful pure joy! The freshness and combinations of food work so well together that it is clear that a great deal of careful planning goes into every menu. Compliments to the chef and the team.The great food was complemented by an equally varied and well-thought wine list; we settled on a bottle of Chassagne Montrechet, which was exquisite and went well with every bite of every course.And as the evening passed everyone is afforded a wonderful sight as the sky around and above changes colour and then into darkness! Just spectacular!Great service and very friendly staff who explained the combination of tastes in the food in detail.An exceptional dinner, that doesn’t break the bank; I will be back again much sooner than in another two years!!"

I can not imagine how anyone who adores amazing food, fine service and a wine list you want to take home and pour over for hours would disapprove. The overall aesthetics very pleasing in an airy and sophisticated way. Higher ceilings a welcome change in a city its easy to feel cramped in, especially to enjoy a meal here. If there was perfect, this would be it."

29004585,20,"April 29, 2009",Greenfly and bland food,"I've been to De Kas eight times and used to love it. However, I feel compelled to write as the last two times it has been noticeably poor and I have had the impression that they're resting on their laurels.I went with two guests on Saturday 11 April 2009. The food - once inspired, rich and delicious - was formulaic, boring and bland: two slices of pink meat, lamb for the starter and pork for the main, each accompanied with an unimaginative garden salad, plus a tasteless dessert of bread and butter pudding with all the consistency of cardboard. What happened to the creativity and flavour?Worse, my salad had a nest of greenfly. I sent it back, discretely, and received another salad, also with greenfly. And no apology - perhaps I should have complained loudly.The greenfly had all of us at our table nervously checking our food for the rest of the meal - another of us found some too - not exactly relaxing.Another problem: there was a card on the table offering a set menu for 100 euros. We weren't sure if this was for our meal as no-one explained it to us. Turned out it wasn't (we paid 80 euros each with a couple of glasses of wine), but like the greenfly this was another niggle playing at the back of our minds throughout the meal.Four other concerns: they really push the drinks to increase the bill; I saw empty tables for the first time; the head chef has gone off to Klein Jansen, apparently; the free apples they offer as you leave are old and flowery.Sad to say but this restaurant displays every sign of turning into a money making machine on the back of its fine reputation. De Kas as it was is over. I won't be back again."

Some of the herbs are grown in the greenhouse in which you're dining, most other veggies are sourced nearby and all the meat is biological.Wine list is quite good, although I'm no expert.

18551995,40,"August 2, 2008",A Culinary Experience In An Amsterdam Greenhouse Garden & Park,"The only reason I did not give the absolute best of best ratings to Restaurant De Kas is I have not had the pleasure of dining with them since January this year ('08). I enjoy all aspects of the De Kas Experience, the beautiful and tranquil park setting, the industrial yet comfortable decor, and the anticipation followed by surprise as each course is served by the friendly staff. There is always the element of surprise because the menu is set daily according to available ingredients, many of which are grown in the very building you are seated: A massive former commercial greenhouse facility transformed into a sleek and sophisticated culinary cathedral. A visit for lunch is usually my personal choice when I'm on my own, and you get to see all the fruit, veg, herbs and flowers surrounding the dining area convincing you that freshness reigns supreme. Even though the menu is set, the waitstaff are trained to inquire of food allergies and dislikes and every effort was made to accommodate a temporary restriction to pepper. Even though I am not a big meat-eater, at one Anniversary dinner 2 years ago my hubby and I had the finest prime rib of veal that was the absolute best piece of beef I have had outside Argentina. The lunch menus are often lighter, usually offering seafood or fish. The meals start with fresh olives, the BEST bread/roll and butter, 3 appetizers, then the entre, followed by desert (desert is extra) and some lovely confections. Beverages are also not included in the meal price, and the wine list hasn't disappointed. At lunch, there is less food (thankfully), less crowd, 1/2 the cost, and I am more comfortable sitting by myself that than with the evening dining crowd. You can watch the kitchen flow behind glass, or enjoy peoplewatching and ducks out the magnificent glass walls to views over the beautiful ponds and gardens. Each meal at De Kas has been a memorable experience for me. The tram goes right by it. See www.restaurantdekas.nl for directions and more info. Bon Appetit --Sandy"
