       "['poor communication towards freelancers not reliable unreasonable and very arrogant would not recommend this placeafter an hour drive from makkum in the friesland province meandering through the eye catching landscape of the netherlands finds the rural giving way to the urban landscape of amsterdam the walk to this hidden gem of an establishment is well worth it from the lush gardens to the mellow ambience of the interior very much a plant based lunch the convivial de kas team add that extra appeal despite only opening at  pm our online    pm booking was certainly needed with all tables full an hour or so later although you wouldn t know with the cavernous ceiling masking the general hullabaloo de kas is doing everything right in a most unassuming way long may it continue goed gedaanif you go for   dishes they appear to have a weekly menu of   options and the restaurant will serve   of these on any given evening the order comes in random apart from one which is a main which is just before the   deserts the amuse bouches were very very nice as were all the mains we had a lovely deserts especially the goats cheese cheesecake onlyu minor gripe was waiting a little while for a bottle of wine at one point but really thats me really reaching out and trying to find any flaws with the evening would highly recommend anyone wants to know how much   oysters   course meal   glasses of wine a bottle of wine all at the low end price range came to around   euros a person i have eaten in a lot of hi end restaurants and this was more than reasonable   stars highly recommendedmy new favorite restaurant in amsterdam it prides itself on serving creative and absolutely delicious food mostly grown on site or at their farm complemented by some meat and seafood sourced sustainably but at the same time they have no issue to cater for vegetarians or any other requests you also get extremely attentive service that is friendly efficient and can provide great recommendations i can t wait to be back again very sooningredients were freshly picked from the garden of the restaurant each dish was beautifully arranged and tasted so good warm and attentive service throughout the dinnertruly an awesome vegetarian experience the food is exceptional and the greenhouse environment is out of this world one of the best vegetarian restaurants anywherewe had a fantastic dinner they took the corona measurements very seriously and we felt safe all the way the tables are set far apart in a very large restaurant the staff was wearing masks the whole evening de kas greenhouse in english delivers when it comes to food and service amazing tasty dishes for a more than fair price we ate at michelin star restaurants before and we left amazed thinking why this has not received one we will come backextremely beautiful inside the glasshouse service is outstanding and waiters have good knowledge about dietary restrictions like vegan food and food allergiesi read the incredible positive reviews and i had very high expectations unfortunately not met at all hygiene and covid prevention very low the waiters are not wearing a mask or gloves and they are coming to your table and speak to you at a very close distance food some products were quite repetitive poor choice in a menu that you cannot choose and the flavors were mostly or totally absent or incredibly heavy the brot with olives was embaressing incredibly fat and bitter artichokes with thorns and a dish with almost raw pumpkin really not eatable the amuses were fine the bread very tasty the dessert interesting i find it inappropriate to let customers pay for tab water the service was nice and friendly but no respect of covid rules either in the kitchen or in the service honestly after this experience i would not come back to this place and i would not recommend itlocated in a greenhouse in a park this incredible garden green centered restaurant that produces their own produce some of which you can see happening the food was fresh bursting with flavor and presented beautifully i found the staff to be friendly and helpful which only added to the overall fun vibe also since they have vegan options i am eager to take some of my friends back later this year for the experiencethis is a beautiful and very special restaurant serving amazingly delicious food no question but i was appalled that in covid times neither the kitchen staff nor the waiters were wearing masks worse the waiters still come to the table and explain every detail of the respective dish they were serving six courses six different waiters all spraying their breath over the food this restaurant has a high chance of becoming the next super spreader totally irresponsiblethe food was nice and fresh and the surrounding is amazing service was rather good too some more aromatics could have been added to the dishes in our view and some of the dishes had repetitive elements eg fried fish seaweed the starter was very light and simple a bit disappointed about some of the local environmental friendly aspects eg use of uv lights to grow plants high energy use offering sparkling or flat water before suggesting tap water which ended up being charged at   euros as well still interesting flavours and lots of amuses in addition to the fixed menu delicious bread toothis restaurant is located in a park in the south of amsterdam easily reachable by tram from the centre the restaurant is a massive green house in which they also produce a lot of their own vegetable and herbs there s also a gorgeous vegetable garden around the building food is fresh full of flavour and beautifully presented staff are friendly and extremely helpful this is the second time i ve visited and they never fail to impresswe were really looking forward to our dinner at this restaurant and the place is beautiful presentation was amazing however when i got to my third course which wa a stuffed zucchini i had to pull out of my throat a massive long curley hair it was awful and ruined the rest of the experience we had about   more courses on top and i couldn t even eat them and enjoy them because that long hair stuffier in the zucchini was disgusting i want to say i would come back but the staff didn t even apologize or do any compensation for this instead we got a bill that was over   i have to say i didn t expect they will treat us like this after this experience we won t be coming back for high end place like this you would expect some sort of compensationlocal affinity the menu tells the story of the garden supplemented with some fish or meat the vegetables play the main role harvested from the land in the morning served in the afternoon the most beautiful and freshest vegetables from plant to plate as quickly as possible the lunch consisted of the following ingredients cabbage mullet plums zucchini vanilla beurre blanc plaice vadouvan cardamom endive samphireand the result was a taste exploitation in our mouth local flavours pure completed with a fine pinot noir rosé sparkling wine as starter from the south of the netherlands and during the lunch itself we had a delicious pinot noir rosé from austria the service was excellent and informed us perfectly about the ingredients of each course during good weather you can sit outside on the terrace with a beautiful view into their garden and do not forget to take a walk through the garden after your lunch or dinneri went for an amazing lunch here with my family when they came to visit this week i will be forever recommending

tables inside were quite spaced out and we were greeted with an array of amuses bouches which were delicious every course after that was a delightful surprise and the way they combined the ingredients was very creative the dishes all looked so beautiful they were like pieces of art i loved the greenhouse as well where one could see the vegetables herbs and edible flowers that would eventually be in

in   we wanted to do somethings we had not done before to make our last trip memorable we had lunch at restaurant de kas it was a good walk from our hotel and the weather was not ideal and we did get a little wet but on arrival at de kas we were welcomed warmly and our coats put to dry the venue is fabulous a large green house but nothing like a garden greenhouse super sleek solar panels auto opening roof sleek and elegant but not over stated friendly service and the food well that was brilliant modern twists beautifully presented super tastes and the price wasn t too bad at all for what

organic growers really hit my foodie fancies this place didwe ate at de kas a few days ago as we were flying home and had an evening in amsterdam getting out of our uber and seeing the glowing greenhouse out in the park was beautiful are we in the right place yes the restaurant is beautiful an old greenhouse refurbished with lovely glasswork hanging above and an exposed kitchen a little of the produce is grown onsite but most at their farm some distance away the menu follows a tasting format and changes weekly to reflect what is coming in from the farm siegfried our waiter was a delight and we loved the way each course was explained to us when our next course was ready any of the wait staff would bring it out watching the kitchen from our table close by was a delight and a lesson in how hard the kitchen works and the dance of cooking staff to delivery of our courses to our table the food was excellent and very creative with dishes using ingredients which we had never seen together our waiter told us at the end of the night that the restaurant had just won best organic restaurant in amsterdam beating out a michelin three star for the third year in a row wow it was a fantastic eveningwe had the set lunch at de kas and it was comfortably one of the best dining experiences i have ever had all the ingredients are super fresh and put together by very talented chef s

herbs and vegetables some you can see as you enter the restaurant and source the rest of the food mainly from local farmers in the netherlands they are very respectful of the environment the setting a

the restaurant has a wonderful ambience sitting in a large glasshouse we had the set menu which was predominantly vegetarian with some excellent gluten free alternatives the food was truly exceptional with   grown locally we would thoroughly recommend this restaurant as part of your next visit to amsterdamwe had dinner on a wednesday evening it s a lovely space a bit big and impersonal but really nice the food was fresh and interesting the service was great for     courses but then the servers seemed to disappear that didn t bother us at all except we skipped a course and it took forever to get the billextraordinary food service and ambience while complex the presentations are straightforward and lacking in the pretensions so common in high end restaurants nowadays each dish was creative unique and delicious i have rarely been in such a spacious restaurant service was friendly and helpful one of the most memorable dining experiences for the last several years of travel around the worldthis place is one of the best restaurants i ve ever visited just wow yes it was that good it was an experience from the restaurant setting itself to the presentation of the food to the taste everything was outstanding all dishes were just exquisite my girlfriend had a birthday to remember and we will certainly visit this place again if we are ever back in amsterdam highly recommendedevery dish was surprising and fantastic you have to be fairly open minded as they served dishes that i would never order in a restaurant but there were flavours that i ve never had before which really was amazing i was a bit worried that the price of drinks was going to be extortionate but was pleasantly surprised when we got the bill as it was very reasonable would recommend to anyone and will defiantly be coming backthank youif your looking for something different and out of the usual tourist places this is just for you the setting inside a smart greenhouse on the edge of frankendael park is just perfect to appreciate the creative tasty and highly sensory courses that are served and described expertly by a friendly waitress i would definitely go backfarm to table restaurant de kas is a special place located inside of a park using farm fresh ingredients this fixed menu is fantastic creative plating tasty courses highly sensory this is dining not fast food expect to spend time here enjoying dinner conversation and the food you eat if you have any allergies let the restaurant know in advance they will fully accommodate tastes and preferencesbad food bad service don t waste your time service was really slow we ate in   hours and a half and there was no dish worthy or exceptionalone of the most unusual and yet wonderful restaurants i have ever dined in the entire building is a green house where they grow many of their own vegetables and the rest is sourced from nearby farms it s a priced fixed surprise menu so you do not know exactly what you will be served and even after you have eaten it you may not be sure exactly what it was but if you are adventurous and have a taste for the creative this is an experience you should not misswe booked dinner at this restaurant while we were in amsterdam for our honeymoon we had a great dining experience they let you have a drink in one area before they sit you down while you are having a drink they bring out   plates prepared by the chef and we also got the fresh oysters we then sat down and they had a cute pumpkin with a note from the staff wishing us a happy honeymoon such a sweet touch we had the   course dinner and it was all so great we had a lovely dining experience here the weather when we went was raining and if you take a car it drops you off outside the park so you have about a   minute walk to the restaurant that was the only downfall we facedthe setting the service the food the wine perfect from beginning to end i was here for dinner with a group of   people and they had the perfect table in an alcove our waitress was helpful with the wine selections each course was an adventure and glad we went for the extra course which was a second desert the setting is unique an updated greenhouse in a park with the main dining room in a large open space a smaller room that i guess they reserve for private parties and then the alcove we were seated in the menu is prix fixe which i personally enjoy because you end up trying new things you may never order on your own it adds to the excitement of the meal everything was beautifully plated they did a good job catering to dietary restrictions the wine suggestions were perfect our waitress was friendly and timely and was fun to be around we also got to visit the actual greenhouse space where they grow veggies great for larger groups due to the space options and they ease of a prix fixe menu my new favorite in amsterdamhad a dinner with family we a great time the concept of the restaurant is to serve sets of menus all food is prepared using only local seasonal vegetables fish and meats microgreenery is being grown in the greenhouse next to the restaurant very spacious interior and very high ceiling which make it easy to breathe while crowded food was really good cooked with skill service was good i totally recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinnerhad lunch here with friends in a weekday despite the bad weather the restaurant was full the food was fantastic and healthy each dish was a work of art i would gladly give this place a   star ranking if the prices went so high the course lunch for   people with one drink per person was aboutde kas was exceptional both the quality of the food and the service were wonderful but what made it exceptional was the space an old greenhouse where all the trees in amsterdam had been grown and the type of food it was largely vegetarian but prepared with enormous attention to detail so that each bite the food was carefully arranged on beautifully crafted plates and bowls provided one with a new culinary sensation if you like food don t miss this restaurantloved de kas cab dropped us off at the corner of a park it was very dark and driver pointed us to pink lights through the trees we walked across a bridge in the rain of course all of a sudden this greenhouse appears and we entered the magical world of de kas a tour through their growing things tomatoes beans herbs etc then we entered the spectacular dining room another high greenhouse structure with high ceilings and spacious tables earnest service interesting wine list chefs choice food had touches of indonesian and other complex spices and of course the freshest just picked veg of the five dishes two of ours had fish or meat then we had cheese and one dessert portions are small but i am ok with that quality over quantity worth going out of your way special occasionthis is a beautiful restaurant tucked away in amsterdam s frankendael park they grow a lot of their own food in the greenhouse and source the rest from a local farm you order a set menu of   or   courses the  th course is an extra dessert which we skipped due to the many choices of vegetables this is a good restaurant if you have a vegetarian in your group wine pairings     glass were also very good my main criticism would be the service we opted to order oysters which were delicious however we were not yet done eating them when they already brought the first course so the timing was off it also took forever to get the bill but still it was great and i would recommend itthis restaurant is set in a greenhouse which is an experience in itself you can also go into where some of the food is grown too the meal is a set menu however as my wife is coeliac they had meals especially prepared for her had a great night a must do in amsterdamthe food here is absolutely incredible i was abit sceptical because of the lack of meat i m not really a veggie person but it blew me away hands down some of the nicest food i ve ever atemy husband and i ate here last night and absolutely loved it i am pescatarian and he eats everything and they catered to both of our needs each dish was beautiful and a wonderful mix of flavors and textures it was also very cool to eat inside a greenhouse and see where your vegetables are grown the service was excellent as well we took an uber there and it was hard to find bc you have to walk into the park not far to enter the restaurant so just be prepared for thatwhere else can you have dinner a spacious airy former greenhouse after reading all the great reviews we booked de kas for one of our three dinners in amsterdam the experience itself is unique and fun our uber dropped us off at the park entrance and we wandered through the trees to find the restaurant glowing in the early evening light service was attentive but not overbearing saturday night atmosphere was lively but not too loud food was certainly inventive and interesting some of the combinations didn t quite work for me but the care taken to showcase the ingredients was nice to see was it one of my most memorable meals ever no but the experience is one i will remember for many yearsvery nice diner with our guests from three continents of the world all enjoyed this diner to the max you cannot go wrong here and please enjoyi enjoy the my dinner with a great service and food is so tasty i have enjoyed it too much and i highly recommendrather unusual to have dinner in a renovated glass hothouse the menu consists of vegetables grown on sight and plated like a work of art the combinations of flavors is exciting but very tastyrestaurant in a disused city greenhouse great food small plates indonesian and dutch menu local s dining part of the greenhouse was still used by the chef to grow herbs and tomatoes look up at the tall chimney outside storks are nesting therewe were in europe for two weeks and decided this was the best dinner of our trip the food is farm to table and very vegetable heavy every dish pre fixed menu had a beautiful presentation and was both unique and delicious the servers did an excellent job explaining every dish while not in the central amsterdam area it was a fast uber ride and well worth itde kas is an extraordinary simplistic tasting menu full of bounty from their own greenhouse this wonderful restaurant is perfectly located in the beautiful park huize frankendael enjoy pre meal walk through the greenhouse and flower garden to see what is being harvested that day you also get to see the honey bees hard at work as you sit in the greenhouse restaurant note can be a bit warm you can watch the blue herons landing in the weeping willow trees this restaurant is welcoming of families and will prepare a kids plate and ask for a mocktail the tasting menu is surprising and full of herbs and spices opt for the local pinot gris it is delicious the staff is on point and laid backsituated a little outside the centre we took the train from the central station   stop and then walked trains very frequent restaurant is in a very large greenhouse that used to grow a lot of food for the city now converted into a very open and light space with a pond and in a larger park team grow all veg and source other food locally there is a set menu and set price you just chose the number of courses you want appetisers were followed by starter fish course main and two puddings all dishes are exquisite as is the bread we went for dinner which was   or   good wine list and we went for the nl wine which was superb with wine was just short of   in total would recommend as an experiencewhat a great dinner lots of surprises with great vegetables and perfect service definitely worth the money and i will go again when traveling to amsterdam i do think that this is not the right restaurant for someone who wants to eat meat as the focus is on vegetables as the name of the restaurant already suggestsit is a bit far from the center but it is dedinitely worth it the ambiance is great food is delicious and staff are friendlypros very nice location care in the detail friendly service cool concept of growing its own ingredients the greenhouse is incredible very peaceful also wide and interesting wine selection i was happy with my wine cons the dinner took too long     hours for a   course menu with very small portions too small tap water is unlimited if you pay     per person the food was ok sometimes there were some combination that i personally didn t like i had two courses with the same celery sauce that was ok for one course not for two one course was a tomatoes salad with some burrata on top from my viewpoint something that i can easily do at home i don t go to restaurant for this to be honest i expected more especially flavour wisea   minute metro ride from our hotel and we arrived at a greenhouse in the middle of a field then we had one of the best dinners of our lives we did the   course dinner menu with wine pairing each course was surprising and fresh and creative we loved that they create a menu around what they grow the atmosphere of this place was so wonderful too service was excellent servers appeared before we even knew we needed anything and made great recommendationsthe setting is amazing it is industrial yet airy and feels like you yourself are actually picking the ingredients for each course the staff is friendly knowledgeable and efficient without rushing you at all each course was so exceptional that it was difficult for my friends and i to decide which we liked best one of my friends ordered a cheese course after we thought we had finished the meal she just wanted to keep going a great experience all aroundevery time a fabulous experience service the creativity and quality of the food just everythingis not only a restaurant it is a whole experience their concept is beautiful the food was amazing every dish was a carnival and the service was amazing since the moment we made the reservation till the moment we left the restaurant great atmosphere and very relaxing placewe came for lunch on our last day of amsterdam having had some great meals for the trip we were expecting something different here with the ta reviews and yes that s exactly what we got not being a great vegetarian i was most impressed with how bold the chef was working on the flavor of the dishes i was expecting clean simple good for the body and eyes type of food but maybe lacking in flavors due to the veggie nature of the offering but boy was i wrong we had the   courses lunch menu and tried scallops shrimps grilled veggies and the amazing desserts everything was cooked to perfection with unforgettable palette to the tongue certainly nothing blend to speak of the ambience and service are right up there with the food we visited on a nice sunny day and it was just beautiful sitting outside the restaurant enjoying the garden and the surroundings with the great food for those of you thinking twice about coming here because de kas seems to be very veggie oriented don t think and just come it s worth it taking it from a meat loverwe made reservations here for dinner before we arrived in amsterdam de kas came highly recommended by a friend of ours de kas is situated in a huge glass greenhouse in side of a park we entered and were immediately greeted by the hostess who gave us a quick tour of the greenhouse section of the restaurant where they grow some of the produce that is used for the restaurant she explained to us that the restaurant also has a farm which is separate from the restaurant property where they grow the rest of the produce used we were seated immediately following the tour our server all of them well dressed in g star denim came to our table introduced himself and explained the menu which in addition to the     or   course tasting menu include separate ala carte dishes we opted for the tasting menu which starts at   courses and allows you the option to increase to   or   as you proceed with your meal depending upon your appetite they were also very accommodating to members in our group who had food allergies or simply did not like certain items in the menu every dish that was brought to the table was fully explained to us including the bread basket and the amuse bouche this was by far among the best restaurant experience i have had as it checked all of the boxes great food beautiful presentation excellent service all in an amazing setting i will definitely be back the next time i am in amsterdamde kas is situated in a beautiful park in a gorgeous greenhouse setting the hostess explained that they use all of the produce they grow both at the restaurant and at another nursery close by the setting is beautiful the service is attentive professional and warm and the food is as gorgeous as it is delicious one of my friends has many food preferences and they were able to provide alternatives to all of his requests our server jasper was the best this was one of our highlights of amsterdamwe went earlier in the year while on holiday and had an amazing dinner the food and service were amazing explaining through the meal as we went in english which was greatly appreciated the space was beautiful and was a nice temperature considering you re eating in what appears a huge greenhouse never had such good gnocchi and their soya beurre blanc foam was one of the nicest thing i have ever eaten if we ever come back to amsterdam we will definitely go back here to eatif you want to treat yourself and have a great food and wine experience you need to have a dinner there please catch the philosophy of this restaurant as well and i know it s not the usual budget for a romantic dinner but i can assure you that it s a great way to spend your money location stunninggreat concept so fresh and vibrant tastes winelist are good and high quality all in all fantastic experienceif you judge the quality of a restaurant by the imagination of the chef this is the place for you if you only care about quantity stay away the dishes are inventive and the flavors are deep make sure to tour the greenhouse and gardenswe enjoyed dinner at de kas on our last eveninig in amsterdam a great setting bright interesting restaurant in a greenhouse provided a great venue to enjoy the creative and inventive dishes great wine selection and attentive service the dinner was flavorful and fun and not to be missedunique and tasty luncheon in a beautiful space great vibe fabulous farm to table food in a greenhouse in the middle of a park beautiful locationthis is the most overrated restaurant i have been to in my life yes it is in a beautiful space inside a greenhouse i spent   hours waiting for   salads and   chicken wing then we were given the option of cheese or cheese and dessert i could not wait to leave maybe if you are a vegetarian and don t mind spending   euros pp with wine this is for you there is a good reason very few of the other reviews mention what food they actually ateto me the best restaurant i have been it is an experience going here the menu is definitely creative it can get any fresher than produce from the greenhouse steps away from your table delicious i m vegetarian so it was heaven for me they also accommodate for vegans and my husband s menu included a fish since he eats meat he is not a fan of vegetables at all and even he had a great meal gowe went for our  th anniversary dinner with the children the food was simply divine it s a set   course meal and the chef can accommodate dietary requirements with ease the servers were very courteous and knowledgeable about the food and wine list to top it off they gifted us a bottle of honey from the local apiary absolutely wonderful experiencewhat a brilliant place what an experience   course meal designed by them they have their own produce which is so fresh and different it is a must visit the attention to detail is amazing the quality the cooking the service was amazing everyone was so friendly overall a great experience and a must visitabsolutely the best meal we had on our trip the restaurant is beautiful and the food was great creative vegetable forward and picture worthy the food is both interesting and tasty i worried my husband would not like it but he loved it we would definitely recommend this restauranti would go back to amsterdam just to eat here we are vegetarian the food was a creative feast even how they serve you the bread is amazing paper bag with a clothes pin i don t take photos of food but couldn t help myself we were not able to get in for dinner but it wound up perfect service was great can t get more farm to table then this your dining in a huge green housejust the setting alone of this restaurant is fantastic it is a large greenhouse set in a lovely park where they not only delight guests with their food but also grow most of their own ingredients the food is really a whole experience in itself and the service is great they offer a fixed menu which is changed each week presumably based on what is in season and each course is a journeymy wife and i ate at de kas a few nights ago the entire experience was outstanding the food was superb very fresh seasonal and creative the service was excellent and ambience wonderful we have eaten at many high end places around the world and consider this right up there we highly recommend itmy fiancé and i had a truly wonderful experience at this restaurant the staff couldn t do enough to help and were very friendly and passionate about what they do from the drink and first couple of courses on the garden terrace to the restaurant experience inside the greenhouse itself really something i couldn t recommend enough if you like fresh inventive and ultimately delicious food and winei would highly recommend de kas the food and service is fantastic it s not an everyday restaurant for a special occasion it really is lovely i will go back in the futuremy husband and i went here for lunch on a rainy june day for lunch i m vegan and he s not this restaurant really is about the vegetables so i was in heaven all of my   dishes were extremely tasteful well balanced and visually very attractive i think the nuances in the seasoning and the use of herbs and spices definitely appeal to a discerning diner the setting is bright light and airy my husband found the food boring and over priced he thought the setting lacked warmth and ambiance i found myself wishing i was sitting at one of the neighboring tables with the other like minded people so if you ve got a sophisticated palette and don t mind spending some cash on a great meal go for it i really enjoyed itwe were treated by our daughter to this fine experience de kas prides itself in serving food prepared from fully sustainable sources and produced on site or nearby in their own farms there is no menu just a list of the ingredients used by the talented and creative chefs to make each course which is then described by your waiter a night at de kas is fine dining in that pragmatic and unpretentious dutch wayde kas in the largest of several greenhouses and the tables are arranged inside despite the hard glass surfaces the noise level was not too bad when the restaurant was full many of the ingredients are grown in the greenhouses or at a plot just outside amsterdam so the menu is very seasonal in may there were a lot of green leaves we chose the five dish tasting menu   tapioca and mustard seed crisp with a celery dip amuse bouche   pak choy and green oil sauce amuse bouche   baby turnip with mustard seed and piccalilli sauce amuse bouche   spring rolls stuffed with lettuce and ginger beetroot gazpacho with mint and greek basil and buratta cheese beurre blanc sauce with trout eggs and tobiko eggs with roast lettuce samphire and oyster leaf roast cauliflower on mexican mole sauce with green tomato sauce corn taco and cauliflower pieces corn nasturtium and dill poulet noir yellow pepper and pickled onion and cheese sauce strawberry rhubarb violet lemon sorbet pansy flowers and meringueoverall a very well presented fresh tasting and enjoyable dinner it would be interesting to try the restaurant later in the yearbeautiful setting stylish food and excellent service will definitely return the homemade sourdough was amazing i m not always a fan of set menus but the dishes we were served were all deliciousthis restaurant differs from any other that i have visited it was a theatrical experience the food was delicious and artistically served one eats in a restored greenhouse in a pleasant park in a suburb of amsterdam you don t get a menu just a list of ingredients they are proposing to serve that day the basic menu is four or five courses they serve four courses and then ask whether you would like some more dishes and you can discuss the options with the waiting staff we stopped at four then chose a cheese plater to share and then went back to a fifth course fruit and mint sorbet the restaurant prides itself that all the vegetables it serves have been picked that very day it is not a vegetarian restaurant but the focus of most of the dishes is vegetables or fruit served with interesting sauces there were fish eggs in one dish and one chicken course although this was my least favourite of the evening as i thought the chicken had a bland taste i loved every moment my wife thought the food was excellent but said she was not satisfied by the meal i am still trying to work out what she means the servers are young and friendly and passionate about the restaurant s mission good wine list and plenty of choice of wines by the glassfriends recommended we make a reservation so we did and from the moment we arrived we were so pleased each course was more delicious than the next unique flavors and textures that were surprising and delicious would highly recommendthis place is far from the city center and is possibly not on the tourist maps but it is still worth a visit when i was invited to lunch at de kas i was rather sceptical i am not the biggest fan of the close to nature far from urban town lunches gosh i was wrong the creativity of the chef who turns the veregtables they are growing next to the place into the amazing meal is outstanding even being the grumpiest person in the world you could never hide your excitement of every bite another suprise i got there was their wine list they stay away from traditional choices and offer you a lot of interesting choices you would probably ignore at your usual dinner i especially recommened to try their choice of dutch white wines service is super friendly surroundings with the garden around etc are amazing i don t care much for this location in the evening but i found this place a perfect venue for the lunchesabsolutely perfect meal the location is just breath taking which makes the experience even better but the food just makes a trip to amsterdam worth it just to pay a visit to this wonderful restaurant every dish is a surprise you don t get a menu just a list of ingredients that you will meet at some point during the meal nothing is obvious and every bite makes you close your eyes and take in eeeevery flavour of the dish absolutely amazingwhat a fabulous location would thoroughly recommend food delicious and a very unusual setting they bring you a menu of several small plates which were all exquisite the service was professional and friendly and we can not wait to go back i would not miss meat with this beautiful food the bread was fresh but so moreish i filled myself up so fast if in amsterdam try and visit be prepared to spend but we thought worth itwhy not dine in a greenhouse particularly if the food is excellent and the highly trained staff moves about as a precision drill team in spite of the large open surroundings the setting is remarkably quiet suitable for a couple or group our five course meal began with a special amuse bouche course zero followed by local oysters and both courses were excellent we chose the wine pairing with wines from netherlands spain and italy that fit the courses well course one consisted of beet root gazpacho burrata basil and radish the beets were creamy and mated well with the burrata following were course two with butter head lettuce oyster leaf samphire tobiko eggs and beurre blanc course three with cauliflower taco mole tomato salsa and chervil sauce course four black leg chicken with aji amarillo and wild garlic and dessert consisting of rhubarb lemon sorbet verbena meringue and vanilla all were bowl licking good dining at de kas was the perfect way to end a visit to amsterdami was a bit apprehensive about de kas however upon arrival i fell in love with the venue a large glas green house set in a lovely suburban park the food is eclectic based very much in plant combinations coupled with small amounts of fish or meat in some dishes portions are small but the addition of bread some amuse bouche to begin will fill your stomachyou dine at the inside of a greenhouse the menu consists of seasonal groceries and

restaurant is o real treat it s a big greenhouse in a love park in amsterdam the food is mostly vegetarian and all food looks and tastes really good all flavors seem to come together just the right way i will go there next time in amsterdamthis restaurant is well worth the trip out of central amsterdam a beautiful greenhouse setting with amazing and unique food grown in their own gardens and farm service was attentive friendly and knowledgeable an unforgettable experience we wished they could produce a recipe book as we had so many delicious things it was impossible to remember all the combinations and ingredients we hope to return in a different season to experience morevery quiet place a bit far from the city center highly recommend tasting menus take your time to book your place ahead of time like a month or so have a walk around the garden park behind   star service modern cuisine presentation tasted the netherlands air soil from the raw materials exquisitethe restaurant is beautiful it is surrounded by a park we took pictures of the garden they served small portions but there were so many dishes i was stuffed by the end of the mealthe restaurant is beautifully located inside a park and it s name in dutch means green house which describes perfectly what the dishes come from everything is so fresh and nicely decorated and tastes good service is good and people are friendly this is my second time visit there and the quality of food seems consistentour australian family visited this exquisite restaurant last month for a leisurely lunch the setting is intriguing and impeccable service was outstanding the food even for our aged     and   year old daughters was nothing short of perfect we all commented that we ve never tasted anything quite as fresh creative and eatable as this meal just fabulous brilliant but small wine menu waiters very happy for us to try several wines before we settled on a favourite do yourself a favour and spend a few hours in this amazing place unsurpassed freshness and flavours book in advancei am not really the beest person to review food but this restaurant was really exceptional they do very unusual dishes and everything is very delicate and freshlovely restaurant in greenhouse where most of the vegetables and herbs are grown by the owners most dishes are heavily vegetable centric with a few proteins mixed in chicken shrimp most everything was delicious beautifully plated and very creative in the preparation these are not recipes that you get out of a cookbook or easily recreate they are truly one of a kind service was excellenti had my reservations with this place however from our first telephone call right through to the dining experience this place is a definite must if you are visiting amsterdamlovely service the staff went the extra mile to ensure we got the reservation on the day we needed and the food is lovely unique and stunning just like the locationi have been there for easter with my boyfriend we had such a lovely lunch the place is amazing and the food simply extraordinary great stuff very professional and kind it has became my favourite place loved ittook my girlfriend here for her birthday whilst in amsterdam the main greenhouse is really cool inside and you can see some of the fruit and veg growing in a smaller greenhouse all   of the dishes on the menu were amazing who knew a baby turnip with mustard dressing would be really nice my girlfriend had the vegetarian options which they are happy to do for you on the day and are equally as good just realised i also forgot the fresh bread at the start as expected also fantastic because it was her birthday they were kind enough to give us a fresh jar of honey from their bee hives and a lovely dessert for freede kas had been recommended by several friends and we were looking forward to celebrating our last night in amsterdam at this establishment we got there early and walked the grounds and greenhouse and visited the park behind the restaurant the library is located through the greenhouse and all the windows makes it warm and inviting this initial experience was perfection as the setting amuse bouche and cocktails were delightful and these ended up being the best part of our evening we were seated in the middle of the room which was ok because it wasn t too crowded but if you want a more intimate setting request to be seated against the wall window the main courses were good but one was on the tasteless side first course and the ingredients in a couple seemed to be competing for attention we selected their   course  e pp because by the time we need to decide on a   or   course dinner we were getting full our wine was  e and by the end of the dinner our bill came into over  usd not sure how it got so expensive and at the time didn t scrutinize the bill the main entree lamb served two ways and wasn t overwhelming and our least favorite dish my favorites were the morels with a soft yolk kohlrabi with shrimp and yellow curry coconut bisque and celeriac with mackerel broth service was inconsistent with different wait staff delivering various dishes overall the service a couple of inconsistent dishes and the expense kept this from being   star de kas does have it s own greenhouse and garden onsite and the edible flowers were on almost every dish they also have a large field about   miles from amsterdam where they grow seasonal vegetables what they don t grow they sources from local farmersdon t let the title deter you from making a reservation this is worthy of the trek to the outskirts of the city to experience the room and the environs i went with my niece who does not love seafood which was the star of the lunch tasting menu they created a vegetarian menu for her using super fresh locally grown ingredients many grown right there both of us liked elements of each dish but few of them really worked flavors competed or fell flat the bread was great though we did not care for the celery mayonnaise it was served with we loved the prawn dish the opener for the tasting menu and also liked the basil celery soup the other dishes used fresh fish and vegetables but did not speak to us presentations were outstanding as was the service i thought it was well worth the   euros pp make a reservation dinner is more courses and a bit more money i will try it when i m next in amsterdamthe setting in this restaurant in the evening was was just beautiful it was a bit further out from where we were staying but well worth the easy tram ride to get there while not vegetarian vegetables were the main focus on the menu the courses were very creative and beautifully presented the food and service were outstandingde kas dining experience though started well having been served one of the best sourdough bread i ve ever had has started to quickly deflate towards the end and left me completely disappointed the dishes were not well balanced and the ingredients used did not complement each other creating some unpleasant taste palettes despite giving some feedback to the members of staff there was no action from their side not something you would expect from a restaurant this level a note though their menu changes depending on their harvest so you might be luckier and have a nicer dining experience once their menu options changewell worth the effort to get here even in terrible weather it was a great experience with interesting combinations made with ultra fresh produce friendly service in a relaxed atmosphere would love to come back in the summertimeapril  pm pre booked in an historical greenhouse a taxi ride from the hotel sustainable organic food once grown around the greenhouse now outside the city the menu is set and changes weekly there is wine pairing and option for more than   courses which sounds alot but each dish is no more than   mouthfuls of exquisite flavour which for me was beyond joy to explore space between courses is timed a range of crockery to present and an army of informed waiting staff to explain the dish and take your dietry needs into consideration beautiful atmosphere of happy chatter under giant jellyfish lights and   hours later left feeling so satisfied that every clever detail of cheffing had been part of it would go back in summer season to rediscover recommended without a doubt well done de kasi had dinner here with family and friends since i ve heard so much about it the surroundings are exquisite the service is marvelous and the food is imaginative and good perfect for a summer eveningi decided to visit de kas after seeing some pictures and the restaurant instagram the place is super nice with lots of plants and with a special atmosphere it is located in side a park so i decided to go for lunch i went there by rented bike it took me about   minutes from downtown although i didn t have reservation i highly recommend you doing it is a set menu and all prices are on the website i order the   meal course sparkling water and a coffee and país e   totally worth it the food was good with different ingredientes and beautifully prepared they were kind to adapt the menu for my food restriction staff is amazing the best of the restaurant is truly the space would go backthis was a meal i thoroughly enjoyed amazing flavours courses made from mostly vegetables but it was delicious at every step and i felt very healthy when done will absolutely be back next time i am in amsterdampassion for the food service and mother heart all in a perfect surrounding where harmony meet new ideas and time sculptures a new experience service is outstanding the food above and beyond any expectation quality very high prices very affordable the concept hard to achieve but worth it be back for sure it was a crescendo from the booking to the visit of the green house well done to all of youde kas specializes in locally sourced produce my family has a complicated set of food allergies and preferences and they not only accommodated us but seemed to welcome the challenge everything was deliciousthree of us dined there a few years ago and we keep going back when in town what used to be a working greenhouse for the city of amsterdam has been reborn into a top shelf restaurant a real treat that shouldn t be missed do give it a trygreat atmosphere and even greater food fix price lunch just wonderful the place is beautiful service was perfect all in all this is an a class place to eati really can t remember enjoying a restaurant experience more you arrive at the edge of a small park and can see the pink lights of a greenhouse through the trees inside they are cultivating fruit and vegetables and you are led into the beautiful spacious restaurant area within the greenhouse it s light and modern with contemporary light fittings and simple furniture that only the dutch do so well the wooden tables are spaced far from one another to allow for a discreet and calm experience despite concrete floor and glass and metal roof the acoustics are excellent and add to the calm the staff are charming efficient knowledgeable and passionate about the food de kas offers an incredible tasting menu of in season foods with some ingredients grown under their roof there is an option of oysters and a couple of small tasters even before the tasting begins each of the     courses was a delicious and delicate artistically presented experience you never want it to end the service was exceptional with the courses perfectly choreographed to arrive one after another without feeling rushed at   for a   course tasting menu it s good value they also do optional wine pairings wow wow wow it s a hard act to follow de kas please come to a london parkabsolutely loved the whole experience at de kas we have eaten at many great restaurants around the world many michelin starred however this tops the lot for me the food and service is first class the attentiveness from the wait staff is spot onthe story of the food is great and they bring to life some random things you would never think to eat all the food was cooked perfectly and the flavours were amazing the mackerel dish was the highlight thank you de kaswe had a wondeful dinner and night in this restaurant every course was an incredible tasting experience the flavors blend together with perfect harmony and the atmosphere is a must for a great dinner eating in a beautiful greenhouse is pricelessthe experience was just wonderful the staff were so friendly and spoke brilliant english and helped us understand how it all worked we went with the most basic a   course lunch and paired it with a wine of our choice the price was so reasonable given that it is not designed to be a cheap grab and go lunch as two very greedy individuals we were concerned that the portion size was going to be far too small but pleasantly surprised the food was just incredible if you re fussy i don t recommend as it is an entirely fixed menu the food was vegan clean organic i originally thought there wasn t any meat but there was a few hints of it which was great all in all the most exciting experience we loved itwent here for dinner and loved up to the hype delicious food great wine pairings sometime the service was a little slowwe booked this as a lunch one day as we were staying in hotel v fizeaustraat near by looked like somewhere we would enjoy but it far exceeded expectations and left us wanting to go back the setting is utterly beautiful and light filled but warm and inviting feeling and the staff were simply great and knowledgeable the food is utterly delicious and well balanced and perfect portion sizes considering we choose the   course menu and had some appetisers brought to us to get us going too really we were blown away with the care and attention to taste and detail which clearly goes into creating such wonderful food i consider myself lucky to have found this place in our city break and wouldn t hesitate to recommend itit s so nice to find such a clever idea turning a greenhouse to a restaurant in the outskirts of amsterdam very romantic and well presented i don t know of course if it is true that all the veggies are from their garden and they are organic or not the taste of all the dishes of four or five fixed courses menu was very interesting but so little that it s hard to tell the most tasteful of all are the complimentary dishes at the begging if you order some drinks before sit at the table the other thing was the slow rhythm of serving the food maybe they think that eating slowly you are easily get full with less food any way if they want to stay in business they should change the little food idea of course it s an expensive restaurant considering that you need to go somewhere else to have a decent dinner as welllet me start by saying that staff and facilities are really good staff well educated attentive and a pleasure to be served by the food was perfectly prepared of high quality and super innovative but and it is a big but the veggie menu was so off the mark in taste and balance two dishes were straight forward fail tasting here there was no innovation or pleasure the normal menu was so one sided sauce with greenery to the extend it was difficult to tell the difference the taste buds were exposed to one chock after the other but it was less refined and varied than expected it seemed that the intended effect was taste explosions and not new interesting taste combinations this must be placed in comparison with the prices which are way too higher for what is being served   for   people and   wine menus we will not go backexcellent farm to table preparations   course fixed menu with all excellent dishes and interesting flavors wine pairings with dutch and other european wines are well chosen way out of town but accessible via a short metro ride followed by a ride on the   tram about   min from central located in a greenhouse in a park spectacularpicked this restaurant for the birthday visit from england with my partner niether of us eat meat and de kas was very accommodating and made us a special taster menu the setting of the restaurant is beautiful the staff were friendly and attentive each dish that came was more delicious than the last before going to this place if you told me i would love jerusalem artichoke sorbet i would have laughed but i did love it on the whole it was a real treat i hope to be backit s a fair way out of the centre but worth the trip such an interesting tasting menu both the vegetarian and non veg menus but the best thing is the very friendly service which is top notch thank youde kas is a garden conservatory restaurant located in park frankendael the place is quite unique it s a huge greenhouse inside the park inside they have a spacious dining room a garden room for private hiring and a smaller greenhouse in which they grow most of the ingredients my friend and i went for lunch on a sunny day and it was truly beautiful i would strongly suggest trying it out if planning to visit amsterdam perfect for a date i would also recommend booking in advance as it is not very easy to get a reservation in terms of food it was delicious the menu changes on a weekly basis therefore i cannot suggest any dishes but it was incredibly tasty all the dishes are built around sustainably grown vegetables produced either on site or in other greenhouses the brand owns outside amsterdam overall it was a great experience and i would definitely go back and try new dishesi ve been in this original restaurant a few days ago it s located in the frankendael park slightly outside amsterdam city centre the staff were very helpful and friendly the design is contemporary and the restaurant is situated in a former greenhouse the food is delicious fresh homemade and organic they prepared veggie meals especially for me it was a perfect momentif you want to try something different in amsterdam you should visit de kas restaurant although i am not a vegeterian nor vegan i enjoyed the fresh colourful dishes it was a surprise for me the only dish i didn t enjoyed as much as the rest dishes was the pointed cabbage because it had too much curry for me the wine was also great you can also have a walk to park frankendael which is right next to de kas definitely recommendedthe menu was all vegetarian fine by me as i m a pescatarian my partner isn t so he was disappointed off the bat my favourite cook is ottolenghi so i was excited to see what this restaurant could do with vegetables short review portions were pretty and extraordinarily small bad flavours i e leek cooked within an inch of its life with a curry sauce that belongs in a curry sausages flavour packet from the supermarket we left hungry and   euro poorer we didn t drink any wine for three courses that were edible we sent plates full back to the kitchen and no one said anything if you re australian don t go our veggies and paddock to plate philosophy and how we serve them are far more interesting cheaper and satisfying but if you do go there are apples in a big bowl that you can take on the way out incase you re hungrythis might be one of the most amazing dining experiences in my life the menu was fixed the day we visited    being a vegetarian they customized the courses for me each and every ingredient is sourced locally or grown in their own farm and one can taste every thing on the plateset aside     hrs for a full experience and you will not be disappointedpricey but totally worth the moneywow wow wow what a place from the first moment you see the glass building you are intrigued and once you step inside you feel like you are in a fairytale you walk past the greenhouse with ceiling high tomatoes micro herbs all other growing beauties once sat down we were delighted to hear about the range of food chosen daily based on the yield from their gardens myself my partner were delighted to enjoy every course one of which was vegetarian this restaurant hit the nail perfectly in every aspect including a great wine list after dinner we wandered into the greenhouse where i was proposed too which topped off the best evening of food either of us have ever had highly recommend this beautiful placemy husband took me for our wedding anniversary celebration de kas is in a converted greenhouse in a park and the food was mouthwatering the menu is set and the seven courses that evening were oysters pay a little extra beetroot and coffee raw mackerel and new potatoes fried emoki mushrooms with soft poached egg steamed black leg chicken in grapes chevre mousse and fig leaf ice cream we had a glass of champagne to start and a delicious assuli grillo italina wine with our meal the waiters resses rotate around the tables each chatting about the course they are serving a special and memorable eveningtake a cab or an uber here it s outside of the city center walk over a bridge and into a park like setting where you will be dining inside of a greenhouse alongside where most of your meal has been grown the flavor combinations here will blow your mind as will the presentation and warm service also they have many excellent wines to accompany this very special meal the atmosphere is unlike anything else in amsterdamall meals were very fresh prepared using the vegetables grown in the restaurant s own greenhouses we ate vegetables we had never tried before and were pleasantly surprised by every new dish served to us this restaurant is on the more expensive side but it is well worth it if you want to celebrate a special occasionmodern organic food restaurant the plate of freshly cut beans fresh salad leaves of mertensia the place is a spectacular greenhouse the food is simple and richrestaurante de comida orgánica moderna tipico el plato de judías recién cortdas ensalada fresca hojas de mertensia el local

really good highly recommend this place to food lovers who are adventurous and appreciate fresh producewe were told to visit de kas for both its unique setting and excellent food we were very lucky to find a table on a friday evening so make sure you book in advance we had a drink before our dinner and they also served us two side dishes they have a fixed menu of   or   dishes excellent presentation and exquisite tastes service was very attentive and warm highly recommend de kaswe loved this restaurant we had a vegetarian tasting menu the food is organic fresh and delicious the staff is casual but extremely professional and helpful the ambience is light and airy in a large attractive dining room that is not noisy at allwe visited for a set lunch of   courses you eat what is on the menu there is no choice unless you have an allergy or a particular aversion to something it was all fresh interesting and tasted great my favourite dish was simply called lettuce the lettuce was dressed with a slow cooked runny egg yolk and sprinkled with anchovies and chicken a whole new take on the caesar salad i would recommend having coffee as you get delicious chocolates and petit fours with it would return in a heartbeatwe enjoyed a lovely lunch outside and were able to appreciate the gardens and grounds that are accessible on gravel walking paths we also walked through the large greenhouse where many of the herbs and vegetables are grown for anyone who enjoys a farm to table experience i highly recommend visiting for not only the food but the groundsthis is a very unique restaurant if you want a special dining experience this is a great choice all of the food was exceptionally flavorful and artistically presented having the   courses allows time to enjoy and make an evening out of it will return on next visit to amsterdamthis has to be one of the best meals i have ever had we did the   course tasting menu each dish was a true experience i feel kinda dorky saying that i d laugh at myself for describing it that way but it truly was my taste buds exploded with each bite the textures the ingredients the smells even the bread was divine some may say each course was small but i was sufficiently full by the end of the meal i am used to nj diner portions if you re going to be in amsterdam def go reserve in advanceperfection is so fleeting and so rare but one must announce it to the world when credit is due a beautiful venue ever so slightly out of central amsterdam a lovingly rebuilt greenhouse transformed into a serene and gorgeous restaurant an actual in house on site greenhouse grows many of the vegetables served in such innovative and delicious courses the menu is primarily vegetarian there is always a fish chicken or meat course starters are fantastic and simply part of the journey choose either a   or   course menu and plan on at least two hours start with a local gin and tonic or blanc de blanc in the garden room we did how i loved the house made breads with dough fermented for not   but   hours experience pumpkin ceviche or maybe chanterelles with a soft poached egg yolk service is relaxed but highly experienced and done with an easy smile plaice served with jerusalem artichokes was sublime share a cheese platter or move onto dessert remember to reserve up to   days prior to your visit and plan on coming back as we hope toa six course dinner experience this is a true farm to table restaurant located in a greenhouse setting complete with their own small farm and sourcing vegetables and meats from other nearby farms the dishes were varied original uniquely seasoned and prepared just right open up your mind to whatever they serve and enjoy this is a fixed menu so if you are a picky eater this is probably not for you i tend to be picky but decided to suspend that tendency of mine for a night and was well rewarded each dish is on the small side but altogether you will have plenty to eat this is a dining experience which is not rushed we were there for almost   hours if you have any food allergies they will accommodate you the bottom line this was one of the finest dining experiences i ve had the pleasure of experiencing good jeans and a collared shirt are finevery nice place to go for an official dinner location food service was very good enough space to have good business conversations as wellwe had the   course dinner and were amazed at each dish the food was original and subtle of taste we really enjoyed the setting and can recommend this restaurantwe had heard great things about de kas and our high expectations were exceeded the   course meal was superb with each serving being excellent and provoking discussion about the subtle tastes and our marveling at the artistry in the kitchen for our occasional visits to amsterdam de kas will now be a fixture on the scheduleexcellent restaurant set   or   course menu that is farm to table with most ingredients from their own greenhouse artful presentation and melding of flavors not for the meat and potatoes diner but suited to those more focused on more plant based and eclectic beautiful setting in a greenhouse with windows and skylightswe absolutely love de kas this restaurant never disappoints with their beautiful very creative and delicious food the setting is also so great in the lovely greenhouse not to miss if in amsterdammy girlfriend surprised me on our trip to amsterdam with a birthday dinner at de kas while pricey the menu and wine list did not disappoint excellent service exquisite food perfect atmosphere and lots of wine i had nothing to complain about all nightfirst a word of warning this greenhouse restaurant in the middle of a city park is very popular so book in advance in our world of too many choices de kas is a delightful exception we went for lunch which i recommend because the view of the gardens right outside is well worth it and they asked one question do you want the vegetarian lunch once it was settled that we were meat eaters they brought us four courses not including dessert everything was inspired and delicious the service was courteous but not intrusive this is a wonderful place to visit arrive hungry sit by the window for people watching the characters who strolled along on the path outside were part of the delightful experiencewhy this place is only rated as number   of restaurants in amsterdam is strange in my opinion it s definitely on my top   restaurants around the world de kas is an unusual place with a set menu where you can choose between a     or   courses we had a wonderful dinner and i can truly recommend this place to everyone the service is so right and when the food tastes like heaven too it s a winner to me the bill for   of us and a bottle of wine was   and for a norwegian like me that s a bargain will for sure visit again next time i m in amsterdamgreat vegan option how could it fail eating in a greenhouse is both beautiful and unique a tasting menu with options of     courses and paired wines the waiter was both informative and attentive a decent walk or uber from the central canal area but worth the efforti ve dined at de kas on a couple of occasions for lunch and diner and it is undoubtedly an experience not to be missed hence i m very much looking forward to my next visit already booked i recommended de kas to a friend who immediately wanted to read the reviews which are obviously overwhelmingly and rightly so positive however one thing we both found odd is that those reviews which raised negatives are by enlarge ignored by the de kas team and do not receive a response personally i think negative reviews deserve more attention that positive reviews you are already aware of what is great about your restaurant those making negative constructive points deserve a response too i know this is a minor point but when everything else is perfect seems ashame not to address this davidpersonally i m not that into vegetarian pescatarian dishes but i went to de kas for the sake of my friends who love this sort of thing and to be fair de kas is not specifically a vegetarian pescatarian restaurant it s just that the menu usually turns out this way if you only source locally to my surprise i really enjoyed the food they served they were creative with the flavors they used in particular they had a dish with miso and fennel which i liked i m not a fan of the flower petals being added on all the dishes but that s neither here nor there since i had a great time at the end of the day and did i mention the restaurant is located in a greenhouse the ambiance was coolde kas is an experience it s not a place where you can just eat you can use all your senses and enjoy something different cool atmosphere kind staff so original dishes do not come to eat that much you have to taste everything but you won t have tons of food about   euros pp drinks included book in advance and close your eyesi had read about this place before we arrived in amsterdam and couldn t wait to try it we enjoyed the change of scenery and walked in the greenhouse garden four of us had the tasting menu and two lovely bottles of wine would definitely recommendwe went to de kas for our anniversary and were so please with everything the service is excellent and every employees were helpful and dedicated they even showed us around the greenhouse and recommended other places to eat during our stay in the netherlands the food was simply incredible every ingredient was fresh and perfectly executed we loved every course the oysters were fantastic and the amuse bouche so creative the restaurant itself is incredibly beautiful the main greenhouse were we seated was spectacular and the ambiance was perfect truly an amazing experience on every aspectwe have been going to de kas for several years now and have always found it an excellent treat the food is healthy and delicious the plates with the sumptuously looking food are brought to you by very friendly waiters the desserts are simply sublime the setting is nothing less than spectacular the restaurant being located in a large greenhouse surrounded by trees herbs and vegetable plots and don t forget a short visit to their vegetable garden on the way out before you pick up one of their juicy organic apples at the doorif you like veggie this is the place to go all kinds of self grown vegetables are being served which is nice if you are a veggie a very small selection of meat namely one dish with pork but i do have to say it was all tastefulthis restaurant had a lot of atmosphere and we enjoyed the concept of eating seasonal produce only from what was grown in the gardens the outdoors was laid out in parterre gardens which were neatly organised the food was very pricey and some flavour combinations did not work eg asparagus with curry sauce as curry was far too over powering it was a pleasant eveningthe concept is simple local fresh innovative and exceptionally tasty there is no menu by indicating dietary restrictions you can trust that the chefs will take you on culinary experience filled with surprising flavour combinations that you ve never tasted before de kas brings the attention back to vegetables which are prepared in a way to satisfy the hunger of even the biggest carnivores but not to worry the main course always includes a type of meat according to seasonal availability and dietary preferences food aside the restaurant is build in an old green house the tomatoes that you eat are literarily grown     meters away from your table surrounded by glass wood plants and a   degree view of the sky de kas creates an unforgettable dining experience for haute cuisine food the pricing is surprisingly fair expect to pay somewhere between     euro per person excluding drinks the perfect restaurant for a special occasion to celebrate to be surprised and to make your taste buds dancewe had a wonderful time at the restaurant and have never experienced anything as tasty as the menue we were able to enjoy here it really was a   steps to heaven meal with all the different fresh herbs vegetables and spices also a vegetarian version of the menu was no problem at all and the staff was super friendly it may be a bit more pricy than other places but just keep in mind that all the vegetable ingredients are grown right there and are therefore as fresh as they can be and you can taste this so it is really worth every penny if there is one negative point to it i d have to mention that the air conditioning made this place quite chilly it was however a super hot day when we visited so maybe this is not the usual temperature just bring a jacket and you will be fine but don t miss this culinary highlightwe had a small dégustation lunch with   dishes for     with option for oyster starter at     each we had deep fried tapioca crackers with green parsley dip and two amuse bouche for appetizer with clean tomato salad with verbena sorbet for the first dish green beans with fenugreek curry and goat s yoghurt was a second dish the last dish we had was baked plaice with courgette endive and new potatoes good service with beautiful bright fittings that made you feel like sitting in a hot house with glass roof great for a novelty value and reasonable price for trendy northern europeantruly gourmet vegetarian pescatarian food we went there for lunch and the quality of the food and balance of flavors was extraordinary the chefs are obviously extremely talented and knowledgeable may very well be the best restaurant i ve ever been to and i have had my share of fine dining experiences and this was only lunch you have to go if you enjoy fine diningwe booked in for dinner at     on a monday night for the six course tasting menu and accompanying wine flights it started off so well with everything looking and tasting delicious however as the restaurant emptied the service just completely lost its way they forgot to serve one of our wines and the gaps between courses for longer and longer we gave up after    hrs and after spending an hour watching the kitchen get cleaned we asked for the bill but no questions were asked about why we were doing this with a course still to go so a good start but a terrible finish mainly let down by poor servicelooking for a place for dinner in walking distance to where we stayed in amsterdam we walked to de kas the greenhouse and got a table for two just by chance they told us they re fully booked weeks in advance the garden to table concept was a very pleasant surprise basically they start from the products available at their vegetable gardens and prepare a   course meal naturally this emphasizes the vegetarian twist with small additions of fish or meat to harmonically complement the crops which are fresh and tasty the way our menu was prepared leant towards the oriental side which gave the whole dining experience a somewhat exotic note sitting in the former greenhouse with a beautiful view of the surrounding park the very friendly and attentive staff and the nice dutch wine made this a very pleasant evening with such a unique experience behind you one mustn t be surprised by the billyesterday evening i celebrate the birthday of my wife we had a wonderfull evening in this restaurant unique location and great food served by friendly staff will come back for sureour travel friends were told that this restaurant was fantastic so they made reservations for the four of us located in a greenhouse that served a   or   course menu we were told that it was a new menu basically we ate small portions of greens and herbs but well presented the soup was about   spoonfuls and very salty the main course had one slice of beef the bread was very good and the wine was decent at the end we all looked at each other and couldn t believe that we had just spent   euros on what i would call an appetizera friend recommended de kas as the dutch equivalent to the lost kitchen in freedom maine which sells out for the year in about   hours with its farm to table concept you were served what was in season or freshly killed first the good stuff the greenhouse where the restaurant is situated is located in a park the setting was nice as you felt like you were outdoors adjacent to the dining room is another greenhouse where they grow many of the veggies using the latest all natural so i was told horticultural techniques the service was quite capable efficient and friendly the wine selection was nice although we didn t try the pairings now the bad stuff the seats were very uncomfortable they would be better suited on your patio and not in a restaurant while the food was very tasty the portions were extremely small we all said each course was more like a tasting the first three dishes to come out were all vegetarian and while they had some different ingredients they tasted the same next came the soup which was delicious to be sure but two spoonfuls pretty much emptied the bowl next came the main course which was some kind of game i had to look for the miserly slice of meat and found it hiding under a leaf finally dessert which was a half a cupcake with some sauce i wish i could tell you exactly what was served but it was quite forgettable once you left on the other hand i can recite course by course what we ate at the lost kitchen   months ago some restaurants don t allow infants we were subjected to a crying baby for some of the time i assume de kas doesn t have such a policy and therefore we had to listen to an infant acting out attention young mothers and fathers your crying squealing kid isn t cute it s annoying to those around you if you must bring jr and he starts crying take him out the others will appreciate it you shouldn t spend   euro and walk away hungry at the end of the evening the peggy lee classic is that all there is was rolling in my head we went back to the hotel and had a sandwich needless to say we will not returnset in a greenhouse the restaurant either grows their own food or uses local produce there is one   or   course menu depending on what s fresh the food is exquisitely prepared and artfully presented an incredible mix of flavours and textures we will be backthis place prides itself for being ahead of the wave healthy and sustainably produced local food having been around longer than the competition we found that they have become rather self satisfied there is no fundamental desire to meet the customer s demands the opposite is true the customer is supposed to sit back in awe for the great things provided for him we were severely disappointed service was substandard inadequate and frankly incompetent we were given no choice of dishes there is a daily menu with no alternatives on offer three vegetarian dishes before a little morsel of fish arrived what an overpriced arrogance i strongly advise against eatin here we will definitely not come backthe restaurant is known for cultivating their own ingredients close by the quality of the food is excellent and also the wine is very good if you like to eat a big portion it is not the place to be they are really focusing on high quality healthy food in a reasonable portion size certainly recommendablewe thoroughly enjoyed our   course lunch at de kas it is very hard to get a table if not booked in advance but we took a gamble on a last minute monday lunch booking and got in the portions are not large however the flavors are so strikingly put together that we walked away perfectly satisfied in addition to the prix fixe selections they served us two other amuse bouche that were delicious the wine pairings were delightful as wellwonderful restaurant in a greenhouse in the middle of a park oysters and champagne on an outdoor patio overlooking the park inside to the greenhouse for a fix prix meal of all natural local ingredients grown on the property or purchased from local suppliers nice leisurely pace and wonderful servers never felt rushed very spacious seating and noise level at a minimumwe went for my fiancées birthday lunch on recommendations of a friend and it could not have been better a lovely couple of hours spent on the terrace in the sunshine with some of the best food i have ever eaten the price was reasonable for the experience with it obviously a pricey place but you get what you pay for i think the ideal for us was the lunch rather than a later dinner sitting but you do need to book well in advancecame here on a recommendation and we were not disappointed we went for thr   course lunch menu with a cheese platter which id definitely recommend lunch was served on the patio with a stunning view of the gardens service was great and they even brought me out a card and some special honey when they heard it was my birthday would absolutely come back here next time we re in amsterdamde kas is a wonderful dining experience with a marriage of a unique greenhouse dining area open kitchen fresh veggies grown onsite and a   course fixed menu while de kas attentive staff attends to your beverage choices you are left to enjoy the ambiance of the open dining area while awaiting delivery of each course as dishes arrive they are described by the server and the taste adventure begins frankly i can not remember any specific dish other than they all tasted a bit off or strange and looked decorative on the plate granted my veggie palate is not fully developed but i did fully appreciate de kas complete dining experiencebeautiful location and a unique experience to eat in a working greenhouse but the food and service fell short of the setting some of the individual dishes were very good to great but the wait between courses was distractingly long on average there was a   minute break between the four non dessert courses i m not sure if the kitchen was in a particular jam the night we were there or if it is normal but it made us more critical of each dish and ultimately the food couldn t overcome the service for a better tasting menu experience in amsterdam look into daalderthis restaurant is in a large conservatory and kitchen garden and serves as far as possible only its own local and seasonal food the explosion of contrasting complementary and sometimes unexpected tastes was just wonderful a small portion of fish complemented the otherwise vegetarian cuisine even as a non vegetarian i loved itgreat restaurant in a unique setting food was all great wine list was a bit lacking however a good option regardless for lunch or dinnerrecommended this by someone who lives in amsterdam would never have found it otherwise and probably would not have got a table had we not booked ahead but it was a highlight of our weekend   course tasting menu we chose to have the wine with it incredible food a lot was vegy and using local produce loved the location in the greenhouse and service was similarly superb one of the best places we have eatenthis place has both a fantastic atmosphere and offers great meals for resonable prices located out of the city centre but with a tram stop near by so very easy accessible staff was very friendly and service minded and we loved all the courses choose this restaurant if you want to try something authentic both dutch international foodbeing in a glasshouse with a menu of food sourced almost entirely from their own gardens this was a lovely dining experience the room itself was interesting including the climate control glass panels opened and shut automatically depending on the temperature is was also lovely to be surrounded by gardens only   minutes by taxi from the city centre after our meal we had a wander into the glasshouse were some of the herbs and vegetables were grown a really nice feature the food was beautifully presented and provided some really surprising in a good way taste combinations very creative the dessert was a highlight but we enjoyed every course of the set menu i would highly recommend for a lovely change of pace for the interesting location and menu and for the attention to detailseated on the patio of this lovely greenhouse garden restaurant we enjoyed a five course lunch menu with a delicious white burgundy on a perfect sunny yet cool afternoon in amsterdam made the reservation a month and a half ago rolling calendar this is not a walk in spot everything served is grown in their hothouse or farm in the nearby country eggs from their chickens and on this day the sweetest tenderest lobster claw from netherland raised lobsters the herbal tinctures and greens were top notch the flavor combos super flavorful and definitely reflective of the make up of current modern multi cultural netherlands cuisine nice wine list beer teas water and soft drinks available menu can be adjusted to reflect food needs or preferences great staff super friendly beautiful area on the tram linedinner is in a greenhouse no choice for the menu although they actually do have a choice i think chicken is always available herbs growing as you walk in simple tables excellent service and the knowledge that you are eating a very fresh organic mealit certainly a great experience to eat in this glass framed resturant the atmosphere was great with sunny day the food was excellent compared to     star resturants just order   or   course lunch and enjoy the good food it is worth visiting the production of vegetable produced in the glass house excelent of company events and receptions make sure you reserve since it is very busy the tram from central staion will take you therewe loved this restaurant we went on a saturday and arrived very easy to get to via trams a bit early we were seated outside and offered complementary appetizers as well as drinks after appetizers we went inside the restored greenhouse to our table we opted for the full wine pairing dinner i think it was   and were not disappointed each and every dish from our appetizers to our desserts was thought out well absolutely delicious and amazingly presented some restaurants do interesting but they lack a comprehensive flavor but not de kas each and every morsel was savored each bite was an explosion of flavor just look at our pictures our daughter is going to amsterdam in a month and we told her this restaurant is a must make reservations as they can get busywe were excited to get a reservation at de kas for dinner but really shocked at the stingy servings of food in a fixed price   course menu the wine was pushed hard while the meals took   hours to serve and we left hungry and not happydon t go to de kas if you are hungry and want eat good food it s a restaurant for the chef not the patronswhen you eat at de kas which is located in a stunning glass greenhouse in the center of a park you feel like you are no longer in amsterdam but in the open countryside the food was excellent made using fresh ingredients from their greenhouse which you can walk through and their farm the wine list was complex and interesting and the service was very goodthis was our third time here the food is delicious very flavoursome some of which is grown in the greenhouse and gardens this really is a special place for couples or friendsi spent a lunch here with my girlfriend i have to say the menu was scaring me at first because of its eccentricity as italian i am all about a huge dish of pasta al ragù and abundant portions however the quality of the food and the innovation with which they were presented left me surprised and happy the food was actually good and the experience outstanding the location is a big plus perfect for business lunches and romantic dinners strongly recommendedwe had been looking forward to our return visit after having a spectacular lunch at de kas   months ago our dinner experience last night exceeded our high expectations the set degustation menu was a perfect balance of seafood and spring vegetables entwined in a beautifully balanced five course combination which could only be described as incredible the young waitstaff were all enthusiastic and delightful their exuberance and service ethos was refreshing and engaging there s no doubt that any return trip to amsterdam will include a meal at de kasif you don t already know what de kas is all about you just hit the lottery for random restaurant searches the concept is fantastic you probably know that if not do a bit more research and you ll be back you come here to find out if they execute what they promise yes damned right they do they could be michelin starred they want to remain grounded pun instead and not have to worry about expectations of having maintaining such just the same we enjoyed every interaction with the kind and welcoming staff the atmosphere is lovely and the food was unbelievably good of course what is growing is what is being served there are no alternate selections so if you re a picky eater who doesn t eat vegetables maybe go elsewhere let them know if you have allergies but otherwise check your potential dislikes challenges at the door and open your mind to the symphony of flavor color texture and finesse that comes out of the kitchen the meal is primarily plant based duh concept and our meal lasted three hours over six courses with bread and amuse bouche seasonal beautiful local the fish comes from  km away in the sea the techniques are a blend of classic and molecular gastronomic cooking the atmosphere is upscale casual my description fails to convey it see photos for more we spent about   each including wine and cocktails which is quite an affordable high end dining experience particularly when you consider that the price for a meal of this caliber is usually two to three times that without the drinks this was one of the great meals of my life certainly in the top five of the greatest meals i ve ever had both persons who went with me feel the same although we live quite far away we will return here every time we can even fit amsterdam into a long layover book itmeal experience ambiance service was all top notch enjoyed it very much the menu was full of fantasy and taste and the building is special loved the motives on the champagne glass you see the trees the greenhouse even the storks on itloved it from the first to the last food service and ambience all excellent i was there for a romantic meal with my missus for her birthday but it would be equally good for a family meal or a work do i would highly recommend and will be heading back next time i m in townloved this place from first to last service food and ambience all excellent i was there with my missus for her birthday and it was lovely and romantic but it would be equally good for a family meal or a work related party would definitely return next time i m in towni had been to de kas last year and was looking forward to another visit yet again a delightful dinner couldn t ask for a better menu everything is so fresh and delicious this restaurant came recommended to me by a local last year it does not appear to be a tourist hang out this is just excellent food served well to those who enjoy really good farm to table mealsamazing place the orangeri is a very cosy place excellent service staff food wine   point we bee backwe had the yummiest most amazing lunch everything was so delicate and fresh the flavors we just perfect the service excellent and the greenhouse was beautiful we would highly recommend coming here every bite was more delicious than the nextso i m not the biggest fan of set menu restaurants but de kas was great a bit of a drive from the main city center but the ambiance was so nice it was definitely worth it s basically a restaurant in a green house with the open ceiling which for me was unique and great considering the sun sets after     in may besides the great setting the food was fantastic as well as the service given it was a bit far from the main center i was concerned about finding a taxi so ordered an uber but coming out several taxis were waiting so i wouldn t be concerned about that highly recommend if visiting amsterdamour group really enjoyed this dinner each course was beautifully prepared and tasted delicious they grow most of their ingredients it is very pricey but the atmosphere is quite casual in a restored greenhouseoh my goodness our meal here has to be one of the top   i ve ever had we opted for the   course dinner with wine pairings and left absolutely stuffed as they grow all their produce on site or on their nearby farm everything was fresh and delicious their menu is planned around what s in season and all dishes are thoughtfully prepared they happily accommodated my vegetarian diet and seem to accommodate a variety of dietary restrictions if you let them know beforehand the waitstaff were pleasant and knowledgable and selected some great wines to accompany the dishes while it s an expensive restaurant the ambiance is somewhat casual they offer aperitifs in their outdoor space and have a full bar indoors and you can take a stroll through the greenhouse it was fun to get a peek into the kitchen which is kind of connected to the dining area my husband and i couldn t rave more about this restaurant and are looking forward to our next visit i highly recommend making a reservation at de kas for a special occasionthis was our second visit to amsterdam and i can t imagine visiting the city again without visiting de kas it is wonderful here food is so fresh and beautifully presented staff are friendly and helpful it s lovely to see the gardens being tended to and then being presented with freshly picked vegetables wine pairing is great and a good value option we look forward to returningit s a nice place the dishes are beautifully prepared and very unusual but take a long time to spend there they take a long time between courses our total time were   hours inside the restaurant not polite for a expensive restaurantit was a beautiful monday with temperatures of   c had a reservation for    pm did the   courses food absolutely stunning the cold cod dish with beure blanc was stunning one of the best cods ever the langoustine in curry creme was amazing my only comment is that the cauliflower should cone before the langoustine rhubarb is very good wines had both the dutch sparking and the dutch white both drinkable but not outstanding service was a bit slow long pauses between mealswow what a beautiful place with an impressive setting in a greenhouse within a park excellent service the food is mouthwatering all from the own gardens and seasonal the menu   or   courses fixed changes every week take the apero outside and enjoy what is coming afterwardswow i literally cannot stop talking about de kas everything about the experience was truly magnificent we went our first night in amsterdam and our standards were set very high for the rest of the trip every dish that came out was just amazing from flavor to presentation the actual chefs were the ones who brought it out to us they were so enthusiastic describing what they created it was so endearing we opted for the wine tasting which i also recommend i also consider it to be an incredible value for what we received it came to just  pp for the   glass wine tasting and   course meal the actual grounds for the restaurant are beautiful service top notch incredible meal and presentation book nowwhat an experience we had at de kas first of all the park where the restaurant is in is just beautiful we had an apero outside with oysters and champagne and the oysters were divine so fresh and tasty we then headed inside where we had delicious bread waiting on the table and then went for the   course menu everything was so good there was not a single course that we group of   were disappointed by i hope i can return soon to this beautiful and so special placeexcellent service well conceived and excellent dishes aesthetically presented we all love vegetables and thoroughly appreciated having them so carefully prepared while not dominating the dishes that included fish or meat which shone as well the setting is marvelous we had lunch on a cloudy day in april it was perfect although i wonder if it might be a bit bright and hot on a fully sunny and warm day i hear those happen occasionally in the netherlands i wish i had taken notes on specific dishes as our jet lag has erased most details but we all would gladly return recommended wines paired well also note that our no dairy pescatarian guest was welcomed and treated beautifullywhat a unique dining experience the setting is stunning a large greenhouse with abundant light and an open kitchen the menu is set each day depending on what is fresh in the garden each course is plated beautifully and the ingredients are unique we had a beetroot gazpacho with burrata and blackberries fried asparagus with chicory and potato braised turnips with egg yolk poached chicken with endive and mole and lemon and sage sorbet with praline and rice pudding each dish had other vegetables sauces and garnishes and was unlike anything we have tasted before service was friendly and efficient and the entire experience a delightthiis unusual restaurant in a greenhouse on the east side f amsterdam provides a lovely occasion lunch in spring the tasty food is like a series of amuse bouche within fairly high price tag and no options peace and quiet in a bustling cityde kas is a wonderful restaurant easy to reach either by car or by tram the setting is beautiful and the dinner not only an artistic but delicious experience the staff incredibly friendly the nice thing is that the table is yours for the whole evening you never feel rushedcreative fine dining without great pretentions the vegetable based set menu is excellent accompanied by good wines from limburg the restaurant shows the best of contemporary dutch cuisine discrete but attentive service made the evening perfectwe went to de kas for lunch they have a great terrace in the sun on  th of april witch was the first day of the new menu the tasting menu is   or   dishes aka with or without desert very nice settings as the restaurant is located in an old greenhouse in a park easily reached with bike walk tram   of what they serve they have grown themselves the flavors can t be described in words great value for money and i could recommend de kas to anyone visiting amsterdamthe restaurant itself is beautiful only a short distance from the city center and worth the trip we opted for   courses with wine pairings the food was unbelievably delicious and beautifully presented service was fabulous the wine was fantastic this was one of the best meals i ve ever had was there with my husband and   friends and we all highly recommendas the sun sets the atmosphere here is incredible the greenhouse simply glows the food was incredible we opted for   courses with wine pairings i was pleased by the sophisticated and unusual preparation of the food and the wine pairings were on point this is one of my favorite meals i ve ever had definitely recommendwas looking forward to de kas for dinner with our group concept is current and they checked all the boxes food did not disappoint but everything else service in particular really let it down now we were a group of   but they seemed content to ignore every basic dinning need maybe it was an off night maybe you should avoid going on a monday i m not sure but i do know i won t be back nor will i recommend others to go disappointingwhat a place and well worth venturing slightly out of the city easy to find on the tram and a great concept we don t eat fish and we re not really massive fans of vegetable based dishes but this place was exceptionalfirstly they switched all the fish dishes for us and we had a superb lamb in curry sauce fo main from the amuse to the bread the two vegetable starters and the local beer and wines it was all round classthe service and atmosphere were relaxed and perfect and looks like everything is grown insidedo iti went to de kas almost a decade ago and recently went back and it did not disappoint the food was fresh sublime flavours and impeccable service highly recommendthe restaurant is located inside a greenhouse the place is informal and original most of the food is produced either in the greenhouse itself or locally the menu is fixed and the dishes are well presented many interesting combinations with great tastes the service is normal and the price level is quite high i would recommend this restaurant if you like to experience something different than most placeswe had eaten at a wonderful restaurant the evening before so considered cancelling our lunch here due to being another tasting menu are we so very glad we didn t it s in a fabulous position just outside the centre we cycled from our hotel which took   mins and was pleasant experience it s in a beautiful setting in the most amazing greenhouse glass building the menu was impressive and i was so impressed by the freshness and unique way they presented vegetables they accommodated for me being coeliac no problem we did the wine pairing which i d recommend it was a fabulous lunch in a beautiful setting and made our weekend visit to amsterdam even more special definitely not to be missedthis place was suggested to us by friends and we weren t disappointed at all first of all it is located in an old greenhouse which has been retrofitted as a restaurant and the setting was amazing i happened to be going for my girlfriend s birthday and let them know that so they had a nice gift when we arrived with a personalized note that was a nice touch the meal itself was a tasting menu based on the vegetables available from their organic farm i m not typically worried about organic foods but it was an added benefit i suppose we opted for the   course meal with wine pairing and it was amazing there were many items on there i typically wouldn t order but i loved them all and learned about some new foods that i d consider in the future my girlfriend also tried a few things that she normally wouldn t have considered and i think every course became her new favorite dish the service was also amazing and very personalized with great detail surrounding each course and wine pairing putting everything together the location ambiance service wine and food made it one of the best meals and experiences i ve ever had i would recommend this for anyone looking for a special night outwe were not so well dressed we came directly after a   hour bike tour in the waterland but were warmly welcome and enjoyed a very good lunch the meals were fresh green tasty beautiful the desert a cucumber sorbet was worth   michelin stars bravoi read about this restaurant in time out amsterdam so glad i decided to book it and persuade our friends to make the tram ride there its is in a site that used to be the amsterdam municipal nursery dating back to   the restaurant is inside a set of incredibly chic greenhouses the main restaurant in a huge greenhouse very contemporary and a great place for any time of day and any time of year produce is grown on site and the menu is set and depending whats available we had langoustine tempura with butterhead lettuce carrot puree and spelt flakes absolutely delicious followed by fresh gnocchi then fish with final and bouillabaisse the chocolate sorbet was shared very good service and a good view of the kitchen best meal of the trip     for   courses wine pairing is an optionthis restaurant was recommended to us by a friend of our son and we d also seen it in a sunday travel supplement took tram   out from the rembrandtplein to hogeweg and the restaurant in a converted and beautifully done out greenhouse is directly opposite the stop we had time to spare before lunch so walked along the shopping street for a while nice area with some interesting individual shops inside the restaurant was a different experience from most other restaurants we ve eaten in over the years climate is well controlled with assurances it won t be uncomfortable in either hot or cold weather outside attentive service from the very pleasant staff with each course explained when it was served should say now that the menu changes daily and there is no choice but with food as good as we had who needs choice delightfully light and full of natural flavours there was nothing we didn t like tried to book for he following evening but had to go on a wait list so that tells you how good it is we didn t expect to hear anything from them so had booked somewhere else but full marks to the office staff for contacting us when they had a late cancellation shows the quality of service you get hereincredible flavours drawn from the freshest produce grown on site had the wine pairing too which complemented nicely light and fresh setting in the greenhouse super friendly and helpful waitress highly recommendedalthough de kas is not a vegetarian restaurant per se they are very creative with vegetables expect small dishes with surprising combinations of tastes the restaurant uses vegetables out of its own greenhouse de kas hence the menu depends on the vegetables that happen to be available there is a set menu with   or   courses airconditioning in a greenhouse turns out to be a challenge we were in a corner with a quite cold draft the staff was helpful and willing but unable to really solve the problemwhat an experience this was the food which is all grown on site or nearby is turned into exquisite courses in a degustation type meal i loved them all and would highly recommend this restaurant service was also great and the atmosphere is very invitingthis place has a positive atmosphere probably the abundance of natural light makes it feel this way all dishes tasted great and staff performed as expected for a place with such a price tag will come backfive or six set courses vegetarian for me all tasty and beautifully presented but possibly lacking some protein each described explained by friendly personable english speaking staff this restaurant is not for those on a tight budget we took the number   tram fare now e  and no cash taken after   march   use contactless each tram has screens showing the next stop so easy to use we had a tablecloth but i noticed some tables didn t as i don t often get to restaurants such as this i would have been disappointed with a bare tablea lovely setting in a greenhouse in a park where fresh vegetables are the stars of the day table cloths on only a few tables and rather uncomfortable basket chairs delicious and copious food for the set lunch including   substantial vegetable amuses bouche and   fine courses including cod as a main accompanying wines invariably came from long opened bottles including a flat fizz from limburg which was replaced with a fresh bottle but poured into the already flat original many many such unfinished bottles in the wine storage better to order the excellent food and a bottle of wine from a good and eclectic list especially as extra glasses of wine may find their way onto the billvery welcoming foh staff pleasant and polite throughout nice contemporary food which i thought i d struggle to find in amsterdam love he restaurants approach to being self sustainableone of my top   restaurants in amsterdam food service on top also on white wine from the netherlands was very good i will come back again and againi have been to de kas at least five times over the last   years and it never disappoints for those who don t know you eat insied a huge greenhouse they have gardens here where they grow most of their vegetables and herbs on our last visit we chose the   course menu for     euros i usually have the   course menu for   euros and it was simply delicious the freshness presentation taste and overall experience is just superb the service is equally excellent they cater for dietary restrictions without a blink and deliver the result in a subtle whoosh all in all a great meal experience in a great and original location de kas see you next time i m in amsterdamthe kas was a very pleasant surprise when in amsterdam the menu is a great selection of international flavors wine selection is solid and the service is great don t miss the wild duck really goodwe ate with friends   dishes menu service was great and the food was very tasty small portions in my opinion   personin january my friends and i were visiting the amsterdam area for a conference we were looking for an adventure not just a meal and de kas did not disappoint it was a very cold windy day so we were glad when they gave us the big table next to the fire place we ordered the wine flight along with each course i loved the single menu so often i m given too many choices and i order things i know rather than branch out and try new things zander and his team did a great job of presenting each new course and wine they laughed with us and seemed to enjoy our enthusiasm for the food the next time i m in amsterdam i will make a point to returnneed to order at least a week ahead i was ordering   days ahead and ended up on a waiting list luckily enough we still got a table though service is really good food is interesting but very much into vegetables expect total bill of about  eu for two persons including wine hot drinks and tipour favorite meal in amsterdam by far michelin chef in a restored greenhouse on the quiet edge of amsterdam growing his own food magical evening as local and seasonal as possible even in february but remarkable flavors and elegant presentation top of the list menu changes nightly but will cheerfully accommodate individual variations goi wanted to go to de kas for years finally we went and it was amazing lots of vegetables lots of earthy flavours and lots of discoveries it s a trip for the senses a bit pricey but worth the experiencethe location is beautiful and the service is top of the class food has a great quality and the preparation is fantastic we had the   course menu   dishes and   desserts and they were all delicious they introduce different vegetables in each dish but very elegantly and balanced only but is the wine cellar because there are not many options but is a minor issue because the ones they have are really good i hope to be back again soonwe arrived to amsterdam late and went straight to de kas for what ended up being a very memorable meal this is the old city greenhouse that has been restored and provides a farm to table experience in the middle of amsterdam the six course meal was reasonable in price and mostly vegetarian although you don t even notice the last course was duck the entire meal was beautiful it was our waitress very first day and you couldn t tell because she had so well trained the entire staff was terrifiic and we started with a tour of the greenhouse before sitting down friends in amsterdam were amazed we knew of de kas this was memorable and worth going to amsterdam forexquisite restaurant showcasing local foods prepared with meticulous attention catered effortlessly for our vegetarian daughter we celebrated the last evening of our family trip to london and europe and were thrilled glasshouse is set in lovely grounds lit up beautifully and interior is gorgeous wonderful and beautiful oh the dessert was a chai infused salted caramel extravaganza that was absolutely deliciousde kas serves surprisingly good food at very reasonable prices they don t offer offer an à la carte menu but instead have a   or   course taster menu the courses are varied and provided amazing flavours using local produce many of the vegetables are grown locally in the greenhouse portions aren t huge but even after the   course menu you are comfortably full and there is always an option of the cheese course   courses were in jan     which given the quality of the food is exceptionally good value the location of the restaurant is quirky its in a park its a little out of town but its well worth a trip truly exceptional foodi ve never eaten at a michelin star restaurant but my experience here was what i would expect from eating at such a place every dish made me look at one of the ingredients in a new wayi shared a special meal here with my mother here several months ago we felt tended to and taken care of from the moment we arrived with a welcoming cocktail on the patio the dining room is stunning in an understated kind of way what a lovely open feeling with views of the garden throughout the food was interesting elegant not too fussy and overall just delicious all in all one of the best meals i have ever had we have been talking about it ever sinceexcellent food and service the food is all fresh and the majority of it grown within the establishment the only piece of constructive criticism i could provide is that the portion sizes aren t the biggestde kas is not only a very very beautiful place its kitchen is marvellous the menue is from the very first starter to the dessert a high quality and creative journey through their garden and local products the wine along with the menue was excellent brought to us by brilliant service the way they work should be an example for more restaurants and the world would be a better place local seasonal organic we love it and will be back for surethis was more about the whole experience rather than being just about the food i ve never been to anywhere like this before i have food intolerances which i had emailed about the week before when we arrived our coats were taken to the classroom and we were shown to our table a waiter then came over to explain the format of the dinner and this continued throughout the evening with each course described beautifully the waiters knowledge of the food and wine was brilliant the food was amazing throughout the whole evening portions were small as i had expected but there was a different taste with each course and everything tasted so fresh and wonderful if i went again i would probably choose a bottle of wine to share rather than opting for the paired wines for each food course although it was nice to try different wines with each course it s a set tasting style menu and i quite enjoyed being told what i was going to eat instead of having to choose from a menu i wasn t sure i would like it but i did a totally new experiencevenue   stars food   stars wine   stars my fiancé picked this venue to celebrate in style and we weren t disappointed the whole experience was amazing would highly recommend if you can get a bookingwen have been here with some businessmen in the evening first of all we had a glass of riesling sprakling wine coming from the netherlands great experience i never knew that the dutch are making wines after this we had a menue with around   courses mainly consisting on regionally grown as well as self grown vegetables seasoned with herbs which mostly also were self grown really excellent i would honestly suggest to make a reservationsituated alongside its own greenhouse this restaurant is a magnificent experience set tasting menu with a choice of   or   courses combined with a wine pairing menu of class the food is tremendous with excellent attention to detail and real farm freshness in evidence upmarket clientele with advance booking the only way to secure a reservation expensive but worth every euro this is a real treatwas my friends birthday and we came for  h to amsterdam we booked a table at de kas we were intrigued by their concept the location is fabulous and very stylish great concept and amazing food they catered to all our caprices and were very friendly we had a great evening and will definitely return againa wonderful experience at all we were a group of   friends and the staff which is truly kind and professional easily found us a table for lunch the location is stunning and the menu even if is standard   or four dishes plus the possibility to order a cheese plate and oysters there is a vegetable garden just between the entrance and the kitchen from where the chief takes the vegetables to cook some superlative plates also the wine list is very good the price is quite high but it s also absolutely adequate to the entire experience if you are in amsterdam you definitely should have a lunch or dinner herelunch is the best there is it is light you aren t sleepy tasting is easier and you can combine it with business how nice life can be this time i met for a bite and a talk in restaurant de kas it is situated in the centre of amsterdam in their former city greenery it is a lovely place with enough parking space in the neighbourhood a bridge brings you into the park in the greenhouse they grow a part of the vegetables and herbs they use in the dishes so it is certainly fresh they have only one lunch menu but ask if you have certain dislikes or allergies in their menu is a lot of vegetables and fruit although it is not a vegetarian restaurant we made a reservation but there were enough free tables a decent lunch is still not trending the netherlands we took the oyster they offered and started with a grilled pear with radicchio and beetroot it had a nice taste and great design the sweet pear matched perfect with the bitter of the red leaves the leek soup had the right textures and got some surprising herbs and some nuts we ended with the fish baked on sourdough bread and skipped the desert they have a nice selection of wine by the glass and the pricing is okflew out on saturday morning fly back sunday evening so we chose to eat at de kas as it s our go to restaurant in amsterdam de kas has changed slightly in a good way our waiter mentioned that new chefs have joined the team and it really shows the food has always super fresh and vibrant and it s now been taken to a new level the aroma of the food is equal to the look and taste we have always loved the fresh seasonal foods and everything now feels more modern and experiential we had a fantastic evening thank youthe restaurant is located in a set of greenhouses with a large open space set up of tables the ambience is really pleasant and predisposes you to have a wonderful evening the menu was magnificent and the ingredients most of which are from the restaurant s nursery stand out for their taste and freshness the staff is very experienced outgoing and eager to help the wine pairing is carefully planned and highly recommendedwe had a marvelous evening meal at de kas the hostess and wait staff were exceptional we asked to be moved due to very annoying guests and the staff was very accommodating to do so the presentation was fabulous only to be outdone by the flavors it was a set tasting menu that allowed us to experience a myriad of flavors during the evening the setting in the greenhouse was spot onwow we wandered in the back door just before   noon and were among the very  st guests for the day once the hostess found us we were warmly greeted our coats taken to be hung up in the cloak room and we were shown to our table the staff were perfect being there and making sure we were taken well care of but in no way hovering it is a set menu based on what looks good from the garden as others have mentioned every dish was as close to perfection as one can imagine each with a perfect combination of both textures and tastes i feel so fortunate that this restaurant ended up on our agenda for our   day stay in amsterdamwe had lunch at de kas during a long weekend in amsterdam in october it was by far the best restaurant and meal of our trip and we ate in a lot of nice places the combination of beautiful surroundings and innovative local ingredients lovingly assembled makes for an unforgettable experience we hope to go back very soonvery pleasant and beautiful place no hassle menu only one choice they cook what they grove in their garden excellent food with excellent servicenot for the light of wallet but excellent lovely space in a refurbished greenhouse in the midst of a park very near a   tram stop serving a menu based on what is available in their own gardens prix fixe menu with a choice of either   or   courses wine pairings are available we were there for dinner in the winter so we had oysters first thing each of the courses was a tiny dish of creative flavor explosion very precisely and lovingly prepared the main course of veal cheek was meltingly soft the least favorite food part was the dessert a lemon sorbet it was very cold outside and seemed too airy and contrasting after the meat the most favorite was either the pickled pumpkin with a coriander mayo the veal or the amose bouche with a wonderful celery parsley ailoi and fried tapioca chips to dip service was so so we waited sometimes   or   minutes between courses and sometimes just sat there with no water or wine left on our table hard to get the waiter s attention many of the dishes are built in the same manner a small amount of a base vegetables with a flavorful sauce and something crunchy along side wish they would mix that up a bit all in all we re glad we went expect to pay about   euro per person if with winewow what a place incredible surroundings which accompany the incredible food service love that you can see the chefs preparing everything the fact that most of the produce is grown on site is a really nice touch would highly recommendgreat friendly and super attentive service modern and nice decor amazing and inspiring food we ordered two set menus with a accompanying wine selection the food was excellent in every way well presented perfect quantity very nice tastes and interesting textures i was impressed how the vegetables were cooked and presented in my view this restaurant easily compares to michelin star rated restaurants with the added bonus that the restaurant is less formal the service was impeccable i also got excellent advise regarding the wine selection and all the wines were of excellent quality the restaurant was completely full party with larger groups of people from what i could judge some people were there with friends or their significant other others were there for work dinners very pleasant and relaxed atmosphere the tables are not too close together so that one can talk privately this is certainly a restaurant experience i will positively remember for years to comethis meal was absolutely delightful green and healthy because everything is cooked with fresh local produce sophisticated with beautiful and unusual tastes combining soft spices with natural flavours the series of small dishes is pleasant full of succulent discoveries the service is attentive friendly and very professional just perfect one of the best meals we have had in amsterdam a must try when in towngreat food regional unusual dishes menue and wine menue are just fabulous don t miss it when in amsterdam and the venue a green house is just splendidthis was hands down one of the most beautiful restaurants we ve ever been to it was easy to get a reservation for lunch we had a choice of   or   courses the only difference between the two being a dessert course for the   course option the food itself was fresh and delicious but the meal was very veggie heavy while we wished there were more meat incorporated into the dishes the beautiful scenery and attentive staff more than made up for the experience highly recommendedwe ve chosen this place to have our wedding dinner there the setting in a former green house among a beautiful park is fantastic we couldn t find more romantic fine dining place for the late summer night the food was delicious and well prepared the wine list was well thought and fair in price i love the inventive modern dutch cuisine with some nordic touch though combinations and experiments are not always successful our friends just as us are passionate gourmands and hobby cooks so we actively discussed all the combinations ingredients and wine matching with the waiters and they promised pass our ideas to the chefs we had a lot of fun and will come back in springthe ambiance is very nice the food were great except the first course cause its too sour the wine for the first course and second one doesn t match the food service was very friendlytake your time when going to this restaurant eating out in restaurants in the netherlands most of the time are evening filling except for very touristy places food is wonderful and they tell yo uall about it when serving visiting the greenhouse is nothing special location is great wonder around the parc before going into the restaurant when we were there there were storks in the areawe enjoyed a nice evening at de kas the setting was excellent in an old green house one negative is that we ordered a bottle of wine we quickely drank it and they open a second bottle with out asking us honestly we probably would have ordered a second bottely of wine it would be another wine since the first was not our favorite remember wine edicate is only to return wine if it has spoiled food was well prepared and interesting the bread was the bestwent here yesterday for lunch it made my day beautiful fresh food very well presented and very friendly staff we will come backthe restaurant is located in a former greenhouse in the middle of frankendael park the restaurant grows it s vegetables menu changes daily the dishes are creative and the ambience is good can get a bit loud when the house is full reserve in advance gets pretty booked out the service is attentive and friendly one time i arrived there to find out they had lost my reservation although the place was full they found a way to get us a table after a glass of wine in the bardishes all great   veggie dishes will come here for sure and fast too in group of   people and all gent exactly the samethis is my favorite restaurant in amsterdam all products used are typical dutch grown in their own greenhouse or farms around amsterdam the menu always depends on what they have available from the greenhouse and farmers so everything is in season you just tell the waiter what you don t eat and the menu can be adjusted to you the rest is a surprise and always a pleasant one it s chique but still unpretentious on a busy night it can be a bit loud as the room is big but nevertheless the staff is very friendly and the food every time incrediblewhile the food here is good and very unique it is a multi course meal with tiny portions and takes some time to get through also while some meat such as veal the courses are predominantly vegetarian but the unique flavor combos keep it interesting the ambiance is open and interesting and they can accommodate large parties they do not serve liquor only wine and beer and the wine selection is limited and just okthey served one of the best food i had all naturally grown super lite even after   course menu real good excellent location worth a visiti am so enthusiastic to write my review of de kas it was truly such an incredible menu prior to arriving in amsterdam i did some initial research on where we should dine on our vacation de kas kept coming up but i did not make a reservation through my research i figure out that it is not super easy to get a reservation at de kas i decided to try my luck and call and see if i could get in for lunch my request was granted my group and i were pretty excited the greenhouse setting in the park is absolutely magical and sets the stage for an incredible vegetable focused meal i am not the biggest veggie fan in the world but de kas opened up my eyes i have so much respect for their vision of veggies first protein on the side the prix fixe menu was full of exciting flavor profiles that i have never experienced before the food is fun and innovative the wait staff was absolutely divine service was kind and prompt despite other guests that were trying to make their jobs extremely difficult think three toddlers one of which vomiting on the table i cannot say enough positive about de kas and would highly recommend it to foodies traveling in amsterdam a final comment i found this restaurant to represent extremely high value for the priceeven if i usually am not a big fan of vegetables i was completely conquered the place the service and the mood were fantastic but the food was the peak of this evening we will certainly come back to discover another delightful menuwe came for lunch easier to get a reservation and were incredibly satisfied the restaurant and greenhouse are beautiful in terms of ambience and setting the food was fresh creative and delicious and they were able able to accommodate and change one dish of the fixed menu for me i don t eat seafood service was impeccable highly recommend and i would certainly return if ever in amsterdam againlocation in the greenhouse is really nice and unusual well worth the effort to find food is inventive in the tasting menu we had a couple of dishes we had were stunning a couple of others much less so but that s purely down to taste and available ingredients preparation of everything was very clever and because the menu is so seasonal can imagine menu would be very different at different times of the year which is to be commended and adds to the experiencede kas is a green house in a park east of the amstel river the ambience is simple and functional the noise level is low one can actually have a conversation without having to scream our fixed menu consisted of a series of small very well prepared dishes that came at   minute intervals and that were explained by the waiter everything tasted intense unusual and just great de kas is not heap but for a once in a lifetime experience well worth the moneywe waited a long time to get a table because the restaurant is always full the food was very good the service was superb the ambiance is very nice highly recommendedbe sure to book a table cause it can be hard to get one it s a bit more expensive and outside of the centre but it s a beautiful place the glass house adapted for a restaurant very nice atmosphere dinner has   dishes and all of them are amazing good place for a big groups as wellwe heard about de kas on a travel video and read reviews in lonely planet and it was definitely worth making a reservation and taking a short taxi ride from central amsterdam the restaurant is in a park and has a green house and garden attached where they grow their own vegetables and herbs the fixed price tasting menu is a good deal and you get to try unique dishes that highlight local dutch ingredientswe had a nicely paced   course tasting menu all of the dishes were good the atmosphere nice the wait staff rather good not perfect the wine pairings were good at an affordable price with generous pours the tables are amply sized and generously spaced the seats comfortable the   tram starts at a dam centraal takes you to within   of the restaurant for easy access the only criticisms i have is that the service felt preachy about the mission of the restaurant trying to use locally sourced produce whatever that means either you do or you don t always and the wine descriptions some wait staff dressed more casually than befits such a setting the attractive lights which are reminiscent of glass umbrellas catch the dead insects and should be cleaned the greenhouse area with veggies was more for show and didn t produce enough veggies for the restaurant that could be better and a fun diversion the park adjacent to the restaurant seemed like a hangoutwe ordered a six dish menu lovely food each dish was a surprise of taste i loved lot of vegetables my husband liked mas did not love his is a protein loveri m really not exaggerating when i say this was the best meal i had on a   day trip of three different countries this restaurant came highly recommended its focus is on locally sourced ingredients and the meals put the vegetables in the spotlight and after dining here i can see why a friend and i booked a late dinner here on a thursday night in september we were staying near vondelpark so it was a bit of a trek out to de kas but the long tram ride was worth it you enter through a park where you walk over a little bridge and there you see the old greenhouse ahead upon checking in you re invited to see the garden before you re seated which is a good way to introduce the fact that much of the dinner is grown locally dinner started with table snacks that were utterly delicious fresh tomatoes tossed with caper leaves green beans and a cracker with an incredible celery dip i could ve just had the bread and that celery dip and i would ve been happy but i m glad i didn t the first course was an incredibly fresh mackerel ceviche and then a roasted radicchio dish with roasted beets that was almost transformative my favorite dish of the evening was a roasted veal dish that was cooked perfectly dessert was a poached plum but by that point we were a bit too full to really enjoy the menu     per person is set and there s an option for a wine pairing     for three that works nicely with the courses the service was excellent and the meal was perfectly paced never rushed and you were able to really savor the unique flavors and textures ok enough of my rhapsodizing just go you won t regret itso glad i had this restaurant recommended to me it was really fantastic other reviewers echo my thoughts the setting in an old greenhouse is different and interesting the freshness of the produce really shone through in the quality of the food i think the beetroot might also have been my favourite but it was a close call since all five dishes were fantastic they were mostly vegetarian since that is what they grow in house but with some meat or fish in a couple of the dishes although i am not a vegetarian i could be seriously tempted if all vegetarian food was this good the service was superb with waiting staff paying particular attention to provide alternative courses for people with particular religious dietary or lifestyle requirements also agree with another reviewer that the choice of wine could be more expansive but we found a nice one to compliment the meal and that s all you need highly recommend this restaurantwe had a lovely evening period the food combinations were delicate and creative my favourite course was the beetroots with a beurre blanc sauce the setting is lovely and the spacing of the table allows for intimate dining i think the cost is very reasonable for the quality of the foodthe all glass building is quite impressive the food was prepared and the service close to impeccable the history of the venue is interesting and the idea of re purposing and creating a farm to table restaurant very inspiringvisited de kas for a business lunch amsterdam is not yet a center for modern gastronomy but de kas is a step in that direction following the scandinavian trend the kitchen is based on locally produced vegetables with only the necessary treatment beautiful servings without unnecessary garnish located in an old greenhouse the distance from production to the table is minimal fortunately it is also a beautiful space so everything kind of adds up beautifully only negative point would be a rather small wine list but that is only a minor issue pricing is reasonable giving the high standardswe followed advice on several travel web sites and booked this place early we asked for the chefs table and were waiting for it got a phone call during our first day in amsterdam that we were going to be seated there after a small uber adventure new driver we arrived it is a magnificent setting near a large park and with beautiful gardens surrounding we sat outside for a glass of wine an a small appetizer and took in the gardens before being seated the chefs table is unbelievable a high top table in the kitchen with staff circulating around all evening everyone was wonderful the sous chef was first out but by the end of the evening we had met everyone all were great the meal was stupendous truly a meal that could stand anywhere as a great example of local ingredients the courses   yea   were very vegetable forward and delightful meat was always a great accompaniment but never seemed to be the focus it didn t feel like   courses the wine pairings were absolutely on point my favorite was a steak tartare with fennel crisps and a light herb salad paired with a spicy furmint unreal we got a tour of the kitchen and greenhouses as well here s my advice when you re in amsterdam make time to go to this place beg for the chefs table you ll be rewarded with a meal that even us jaded foodies were left spellbound by thanks folksmy fourth time in this great rrstaurant with my wife we have spent a wonderful time dekas great food with fusion cuisine gorgeous burata harmonization with excelent wines   dishes   stars as fish one basis foam of seafood great veal with a spetacular sauce delicious dessert cardamono icecream lol hungry again to come back to this place inside a beautiful fredericksplain and niddle giant birdsthnks kas equipone of the best places for dinner when in amsterdam great ambiance friendly staff and off course excellent food i strongly recommend to try the chefs table in the kitchen for a unique experienceexcellent service and delicious good price   euros for   course meal decor service and presentation of dinner were all impressive and well presented the food was amazing and felt very light and healthy at the same time definitely a must try and return if you canservers were ok but the food ranged from boring to downright bad if you re only going to offer a single prix fixe you can t suck as bad as this did i gave second star for nice locationtwo couples and a baby we had   wine pairings and a port the wines were quite pleasant and complimented the vegetarian preps beautifully the main course of fish was light white crisp and flavorful the cheese board was enough for four people the waiters were well versed and pleasant and they even played with babythis restaurant is very high end the food was very unique and creative with a nice presentation servers were a little up tightwe have been to de kas before about   years ago we thought it was terrific this time not so good you can have a perfectly good meal at de kas however at least for me it wasn t memorable not even memorable for the   minutes after i ate it i have been to too many tasting menus where edible flowers are the main event too many places where there is always a bit of food in the middle of a plate where the waiter finishes it with a sauce poured from a beaker it ok when the sauce is sublime however at de kas it was just some sauce i am happily on my way to an auberge in bordeaux where i know that i will eat much better food that it will look better and be at a lower price i understand that de kas has changed chefs perhaps they need a further tune upthis was a beautiful surprise venturing to de kas as our first dinner in amsterdam we are vegetarian and called to make sure they can accommodate us for their fixed dinner you enter the park and go to the conservatory greenhouse walk through the greenhouse to get a sense of their amazing vegetables and herbs each dish was an artistic creation of presentation and tastes service was fantastic you don t have just one waiter you have the staff attending to your needs water cocktails dinner everyone is there to give you a wonderful dinner experienceamazing place for romantic dinner with great food and outstanding service the only tip i can give to the management is to extend a bit the wine listde kas still has a reputation though it became more or less a tourist trap the dishes are still pretentious but they are not good enough to legitimate this only the desert with cherries was realky worth the trip the rest was okay but quite expensive so was the wine the location still is incredible and the staff know what they are doing however i cannot get rid of the felling that this place is overratedi shall start by awarding de kas the michelin star it is worthy of the aesthetic and function of the room is near perfect as much thought has gone into the guests comfort as the menu itself the night we dined the menu was limited to a   coarse tasting menu which was outstanding the greens were garden fresh and the chef was careful not to over complicate the dishes and let the food speak for itself with most everything being locally sourced even the recommendation of a dutch sparkling wine over a french champagne was well received and appreciated daniel provided service that was professional and personable and took the time to give me and my daughter a tour of the greenhouse following our dinner a very memorable evening for certain and very possibly one of my most favourite dinner ever thank you de kas for a very memorable eveningde kas serves healthy food in a large greenhouse style restaurant with a glass roof which gives a nice impression in the evening the food is home grown by the restaurant expect low focus on meatmagnificent restaurant in amsterdam fresh in ingredients from the garden and the food is incredible fresh and light and full of flavour highly recommendone of the best meals i had on vacation ever it is definitely a treat to eat here everything is so fresh and they change the menu daily depending on the fresh food that is harvested very clean place and the food is amazingly fresh and everything tasted so good and the price is not bad at allde kas was recommended to us by some friends in france the restaurant is situated in a very beautiful greenhouse setting the greenhouse is located in a nice park the food is all very fresh and tasty we really enjoyed all the flavors in the   course de kas is a must try restaurant when in amsterdambeware that the meal is primarily veggies it s great for vegetarians but for us carnivores it was a disappointment it s a lovely setting and the food is beautifully prepared and presented but if you are a protein fan you will not be happy note to de kas why not post some sample menus on your site so that anyone coming can get an idea of a typical meal the portions are really tiny and i m not a big eater the amuse bouche was one small piece of cauliflower with sauce and poppyseed crumbles this was followed by beets topped with some burrata second course was braised chicory in curry sauce with some sort of grain topping then a dish with two     pieces of zucchini topped with three mussels the main was two very small pieces   cube of chicken breast with a few tiny pieces of pasta and sauce the dessert was actually pretty good one small scoop of ice cream with some poached plums leaving hungry we actually considered stopping for another bite the service although pleasant was lacking we were in the middle of our amuse when the server brought out our first course we had only been there   minutes we had to flag down another waiter for more wine i had to ask for silverware when the second course arrived because the server never replaced it and didn t notice that i had none for a fine restaurant these lapses are totally inexcusable to the chefs at de kas perhaps you are taking yourselves too seriously how bout an ala carte menuthe atmosphere is fantastic and the food is even better we traveled for a few months throughout europe last year and this was one of the highlights our local friends recommended it and we were happy all aroundsitting in the garden lovely shaded tables all fresh produce in front of you served in your food it is really one of the true treats of amsterdam huge indoor space as well but what is the point and the food was amazingit was wonderful each of the   courses were a work of art and everyone one of the them was deliciousthis is my second visit to amsterdam this year and my second visit to de kas it will be hard to come back to amsterdam a third time without booking a table a different season brought a completely different menu beetroot gazpacho courgettes with mussels fennel with onion rings so good duck with seared red cabbage best dish my partner and i had eaten in a long time and red fruit with meringue every course was so fresh and bursting with flavour and the service was impeccable bookwether for lunch or for dinner we love stopping at de kas for the finest fresh vegetables and selected bits served in artful creative waysa beautiful experience went for the set lunch and everything tasted as good as it looked so much food these days is so visually focused that they forget it needs to be delicious more important to be instagrammable not the case here beautiful but bursting with flavor and freshness the setting is so lovely and relaxing you d never know you were in a city don t forget to check out the greenhouse and the gardens a really good value wine pairings great toowe always try to get recommendations from friends for places to see and dine at restaurant de kas was one of these recommendations and it was spectacular the restaurant grows its own produce and gets its meat from local suppliers it serves everything from a fixed menu which is dictated to a degree by what the farm has available and therefore brand new   days a week it s as close to farm to table as you re going to get but don t let that lead you to believe you ll get anything short of an in incredible meal each course there are   is a delicious combination of culinary creativity and beautiful plating all served and bussed by a stellar staff the dick breast serves this evening was absolutely flawless i can t recommend this restaurant any higher but if trip advisor gave more than   stars i d give the max to de kas when you re in amsterdam get a reservation you will be blown awayoutstanding stunning restaurant situated in a stylish greenhouse where all vegetables ending up on your plate are grown on site we had a mouthwatering   course tasting menu that consisted of fresh and delicious food for less than   that s the real deal it s important to mention that wine pairings perfectly complemented every single course service was extremely professional super attentive yet unobtrusive the setting that de kas offers couldn t be more unique and absolutely gorgeous all in all a very stylish place serving some fantastic yummy food we ll be back pgwhat an amazing meal truly stunning location and lovely staff we went for the   course dinner with matching wines and really couldn t fault anything highlights were the beautifully presented beetroot gazpacho and ricotta mousse with peas very classy place and actually i thought quite reasonable for the quality   euro for dinner menuunique style with fresh ingredients grown up in the restaurant itself pretty high level of quality service can be improved i was there for a business dinner and we all enjoyed the place and we have a great nightwe were at de kas last night and had a lovely experience the setting was unique in amsterdam the ambience was great the staff were knowledgable courteous and helpful and last but not least the food was excellent so long as you like your vegetables if you re local it s a must if you re a visitor and want to get away from the city centre it s an easy tram ride and will absolutely be worthwhilewe had a wonderful evening in this beautiful greenhouse the staff was super friendly very well trained and informed the menu was surprising and each course made us wonder how the next one would be like i really recommend this restaurant for a special night outthe location is a pure oasis in the middle of the city beautifull really it totally gives that old greenhouse feel it s spacious with enough room between the tables to conversate privately the food is simple amazing michelin star worthy every dish is an amazing experience of flavours mixed together there s   menu based on what comes from the greenhouse means the food is super fresh and very surprising great restaurant for both romantic dinners as for business purposes will go here again if i can many timesgood fresh food very special dishes the place itself is interesting many greenhouses with fresh vegetables inside a nice gardenthis restaurant grows its own vegetables and serves mostly small vegetarian dishes you sit in a large glass enclosure not too different from the nearby greenhouses and you are surrounded by a beautiful park there is a large selection of wines and the host will be happy to suggest which wine goes with each dish all of that said the food itself is good but i wouldn t call it exceptional without the overall experience i would say it s not worth the pricede kas a restaurant built in an old hidden greenhouse in the middle of amsterdam city the restaurant offers to customers an excelent gastronomic experience which the real meaning of fresh igrediants is taken serious i do recommendthe restaurant is located in a re purposed green house that sits in a wonderful natural park in amsterdam so the ambience enhances the entire dining experience the lunch tasting menu was filled with seasonal food that was all incredibly fresh tasty and light the contrast of flavours and textures was excellent overall an incredible lunch when you add the location together with the foodwe had a group dinner event for   people at de kas when we arrived we had a tour of the greenhouse and grounds we learnt that they use things grown on premises it was a   course menu starting with appetizers soup entrees and dessert paired with wines and other drinks they used various vegetables roots leaves fruits flowers very creatively along with meats fish chicken the presentation of every plate was very beautiful full of colors textures solids liquids and it all tested very very good portions were just the right size and the servers timing was perfect everyone in our party was busy taking pictures and sending them to their family posting online etc i would love to visit again with my familyhard to find the right superlative for this fabulous restaurant we were pleased with a late notice lunch booking so book ahead as you plan your amsterdam schedule easy to reach from the central area on the   tram set in an extraordinary glass house and surrounded by its own herb garden the food lived up to the setting with world class flavours in a menu using fresh ingredients we would have gone again but sadly no more availability make the effort to go to this placei can t begin to describe how delicious everything was especially the vegetable dishes we had a beetroot salad and a green gazpacho for our first two courses and they were just perfect i don t know what they did but i want to eat every meal of my life at de kas everything we had was delicious down to the bottle of rose our server recommended i drink a lot of rose and this was just the best and very affordable the quality of the meal far surpasses the more expensive tasting menus i ve had in my day it just shows what making a menu around seasonal local as local as possible in this case items can doonly a   drive from the center this restaurant is located in a park very relaxing and original seating you feel immediately very well only   menu with   courses mainly based on self produced bio vegetables but w o excluding fish meat cheese it starts already very promisingly with the appetizers and the menu continues to exceed our expectations until the dessert also service is relaxed friendly and competent also a nice choice of wines a really winning concept offering to the lovers of vegetables an outstanding price quality ratio i will consider it also for business dinnersin an extremely nice setting you can taste creative dishes prepared with ingredients from their own green house they know how to use herbs in a nice way cuisine is light vegetables dominates over meat and fish menu changes often due to daily seasonal availability of vegetables menu is fixed they suggest matching wines for each dish food was very nice while i did not like so much wines greco di tufo was from a minor winery and was average not cheap   each including bottle of champagne and   different wines but absolutely recommended for a dinner with friendslocal seasonal food in superb surroundings set menu   courses without wines   euro money well spent food was innovative delicious and like mentioned earlier seasonal and local they have an attached green house visit and experience what you are going to enjoy in your plate later staff was having good time and they enjoyed their work and it related into customer service friendly and professional always smiling   pointswe were excited to try this place out as our last dinner on our   night trip to amsterdam this was the perfect combination of a lovely setting in a park a bit away from the center fresh farm to table food a beautiful modern greenhouse setting and absolutely delicious fresh food they create a new set menu every week it s   courses with lots of fresh vegetables which i love the portions are very ample but since the food is on the healthier side it s a pleasure to eat great wine pairings overall i thought it was reasonably priced for the quality presentation and amount of food given to us the server was excellent very friendly explained everything to us showed us the greenhouse after dinner where they grow some of the food and took our pics it was an excellent ending to our first trip visiting amsterdamhard to fine but don t miss this special dining experience in amsterdam located in a park you have to walk from the street across a bridge to get to this restaurant our uber driver and his gps got us close but the house next door wasn t amused when i knocked on the door to ask how to get to it once there experienced a great   course meal with most of the incredients coming from the garden in this greenhouse still reasonable for a   course meal toowe enjoyed the experience of this restaurent we had a set meal of five courses freshly prepared in view of the restaurant the food was slightly unusual from the average restaurent a lot of the produce served was grown in their own greenhouse and gardenthis is a fine little gem in amsterdam the interior in stunning it s pretty much a greenhouse in its entirety and eyes very spaciously indeed they grow their own fruit and veg in their own greenhouse and farm their own meat the set menu is a delight just let yourself be surprised by their amazing concoctions of fresh ingredients from starters through to the delicious desserts this place will not disappoint and is a great venue for couples friends or business meals alikei went to this restaurant for a business dinner and was initially impressed by the sustainable focus of the food with on site greenhouse and open and comfortable atmosphere however these did not hold a candle to the very impressive food which was not only sustainable but also creative both in appearance and taste from the appetizer to dessert this excellent sustainable restaurant with creative dishes is highly recommendedfantastic setting very tasty farm to table food choice attentive service well worth the travel time to this restaurant off the typical tourist scene in amsterdamdinner at de kas was for a special birthday and the food didn t disappoint my only sadness was that when asked to confirm my booking the night before i did say that i was bringing someone for a special birthday but sadly this wasn t taken note of this said i would still visit again as it s a very special spoti look back fondly on de kas and can t wait for an opportunity to take me back the fixed menu is exciting and delicious staff are incredibly knowledgeable and open to answer and question as i have a allergy they were highly accommodating i thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience from start to finishyes this meal was expensive but you can t get a meal like this anywhere else food is grown fresh there and take foods you hate and turn them into something incredible it s a must do one thing service was okay but i think it was normal by holland standards just not americanit s hard to imagine a better meal than our dinner at the restaurant de kas in amsterdam each part of the tasting menu paired with the perfect wine was just a delicious surprise a beet salad like no beet salad i ve tasted melded flavors in a lovely delicate way the gazpacho again like no other contained almost no soup but leaves and lovely combinations of flavors to create such tastes the beef cut in strips was also delicious and the dessert of rhubarb cherry sorbet pastry and some other good flavors just blew me away go there if you canwe visited the restaurant for my husband s birthday and although it s not cheap it s a really good experience and amazing and different food the emphasis is mostly on vegetables although a couple of the courses included meat and fish too but they did vegetarian and pescatarian versions for us all the vegetables and fruits used are seasonal and mostly grown there in the greenhouse which is really nice i m not sure why a few reviews said the portions were small we had   courses instead of   and we were so full with all different sorts of things like they do and having   or   course you don t want each one to be huge the greenhouse setting in the park is really pretty and especially at night when it s all lit upone of my top dining experiences ever for     euro you are treated to a five courses of amazingly fresh beautifully presented intricately flavored food all this in a beautiful greenhouse surrounded by gardens in a quiet amsterdam park my husband and two twenty year old sons are still talking about this dinner the staff is young fun and very knowledgeable about the food and wine service is impeccable and served at a leisurely paceafter several attempts to book at short notice i finally got my act together and booked in time to get a table it was well worth the effort the dinner menu is fixed with the option of   or   courses inside a greenhouse looking out on water and greenery the menu is hard to fault subtle flavours beautifully presented and although the menu is fixed they ask about dietary requirements and foods you don t like right at the start there is a wine tasting menu if you want a fresh glass with every course we set a pinot noir well known against a dutch dornfelder unknown the dornfelder was empty first enough said give it a try we also had a dutch sparkling wine with the amuse bouche it s dry with a light sparkle another one worth trying the service was excellent the staff were charming and knowledgeable especially the female sommelier who s knowledge on all the selections we made and how they d go with foods was impressive the venue sits a little out of the centre probably a cab tide for some it is a few metres away from the street in its own manicured gardens approached over a pedestrian bridge at   head for the   courses it seems a little more expensive than some restaurants in amsterdam in terms of quality value for money and good experience this is a stand out choicebeautiful setting fresh farm ingredients grown right in front of you greenhouse effect resturant and delightful preparations food is great portion sizes small and pricing fine dining worth a try oncewow for the picturesque setting the dining area evokes a green house from whence one can look out to the resplendent surrounding greenery for the friendly and courteous service for the delightful   courses each dish thoughtfully prepared with freshness you can see smell and taste for the inventive presentation for the fantastic value i would ve happily paid   times what we were charged i just wish it were easier to get a reservation heading back to amsterdam for a visit and de kas is booked on the day i m therethe setting the informality the creativity of the menu the pacing of the dinner it doesn t get better than this fixed menu changes weekly everyone eats the same thing well worth the extra time to get here and worth every last euro of the costthis greenhouse restaurant welcomes its guest with natural light and a soaring ceiling our group opted for the full   courses and wine pairing which was a delicious way to spend a few hours this is an understandably popular spot plan ahead for a reservationde kas is a most wonderful experience setting most unusual right in the middle of a lovely park and produce growing in adjoining greenhouse and vegetable plots each course beautifully prepared presented and quite a unique experience set in a lovely tranquil public park the public allotment area is well worth a stroll if only to work up an appetite not essential given to lovely food service was excellent and staff most friendly i even got guidance on how to properly grow fennel in my own garden price too was reasonable given such an excellent experience just a short trip on a tram from dam square make sure you book thoa fantastic lunch experience more than good food de kas is an elegant restaurant inside a park quite a lot of ingredients are grown at the garden next to the kitchen i could feel love respect service 能夠吃到這麼有愛心的餐廳感覺很幸福de kas is not a restaurant but an experience a true journey inside the tastes and colors of biofood designed using flowers you will eat in a techno greenhouse surrounded by the trees of a beautiful park ultimately one of the best restaurant in amsterdamhands down one of the best meals i ve had this tops bondi icebergs my previous favourite went for lunch   courses with matching wines outstanding food and service if you are in or going to amsterdam do not pass in this place quite a distance from the city centre but so worth it had gone to guts glory the night before and that was delicious but this easily surpassed it couldn t recommend if highly enoughwe were staying at a vrbo a few blocks away and the owner had recommended this restaurant for an evening meal the meal is an event we enjoyed awesome courses   courses total everything was amazing the use of fresh veggies from the attached greenhouse and farm fresh ingredients was very inventive the presentation and service is top notchwe enjoyed a real good and relaxed dinner at de kas with the new kitchen crew the menu concept changed a little from three courses to now six courses with wine pairing but at same price as before dishes are made with seasonal and local ingredients all dishes we re executed perfectly with great attention for detail combinations of foods work very well the ambience and the surrounding park is beautiful staff is friendly value for money in amsterdami am usually not a huge fan of creative cuisine i often prefer traditional dishes and familiar tastes but i have to say de kas was an amazing surprise went there with a large group of friends and everyone had a great time the food was served timely the service was good better than your average service in amsterdam which is not great and all   dishes truly tasty it s a fixed menu so you can t choose what you eat but you won t regret it at one point they served a beetroot gazpacho i hate beetroots with a passion and yet i enjoyed the dish as it was absolutely delicious the setting is also lovely definitely worth the price and the hypeit s a bit away from the center of amsterdam and in the lovely setting warm welcome upon arrival and the service was pleasant they accommodated pescatarian meals and other special diet needs the dishes were flavorful with beautiful garnishment one small disappointment was there was no one at the door for us to retrieve our coats other than that we had a lovely eveningstrongly recommend to go in day time this greenhouse restaurant allows plenty of sunshine but yet comfy to dine in blue sky greens surrounding and the garden creature alike dish would surely impress you lunch is a   or   course set with optional wine pairing there is no a la carte but i do believe all diners are in chefs good hand be adventurous and finish everything on the plate they might look bit fancy but surely edible the restaurant also offered organic apples as souvenirs when the staff walked you to the doorwe bought the full six course chef s menu with wine pairings and expected decent service it is apparent they are putting their effort into the food including fresh vegetables from their garden but the staff lacked training and there was no apparent supervision on the floor the wine pairings were always served after we were already eating the course once almost finished the wine pour sizes were very inconsistent our water and wine glasses were empty four different times during the meal and at one point i was thirsty enough to get up and walk across to where they had our sparkling water to pour a round for our table myself no one came to interrupt me from doing so which told me they lack supervision for us this problem and a lot of waiting between courses took away from enjoying the food although it was quite well prepared they need to remove the five and six course tasting menus or refocus on their service it wasn t expensive but overall i have to give them an average scorethis is the second time i visit this top restaurant of amsterdam last time a year ago i tried chef s table which is more interesting from a gastronomical perspective but can be a bit lonely if your company is not too interesting this time i tried the   course dinner including wine package one can with no doubt say that the wines are not up to the standard of the food anyhow me and my   guests liked to sit in the nice eating hall with all tables full of activity and people i will come back some daywe had dinner here on our last night and it was a great way to cap off a very memorable amsterdam experience the menus are prixe fixe and in the   euro range for four courses it s farm to table and the food was excellent needless to say the restaurant was packed and we had made the reservations approx   month s earlier we went to a lot of great restaurants in amsterdam and we felt this was the best dinner for   including a bottle of wine and tip was approx   eurosthe freshest food in this buzzing greenhouse restaurant is beautifully prepared and presented friendly staff cope well with the large number of dinersterrific avant garde fix prix dinner in very eclectic setting worth visiting try to get the table in the kitchen for up close chef workdined here with friends hard to get a reservation great setting inside remodeled city greenhouses very friendly attractive helpful staff the food is locally sourced organic very creative combinations which change each day we had braised chard with small bites of rose tenderloin baked endive with gremolata slow cooked chicken with white adperagus radish a delicious dessert of rhubarb compote elderflower ice cream almond crumble would return often if possibleexcellent ambiance great service and amazing farm to table food we opted for the wine pairing and would highly recommend it to anyonei have been to de kas now for two times and each time i love the food the price quality rate is perfect its not a cheap place to eat but the quality of the food is amazing additional the greenhouse itself is beautiful and its a great to go to with friends or for business purposes the staff is great in their service and i would recommend the restaurant to everyonei went to de kas with my girlfriend for dinner and we had an interesting food experience we had a   course meal   meat   vegetarian and one desert even i am a meat guy i can say that all the dishes were good and the fact the de kas grows it s own veggies gives a great taste to everything in your plate it was one of the most interesting meals i had and even if the dishes are quite small at the end i felt full for and different food experience try de kas i am glad i did itmy girlfriend and i planned a dinner at de kas after hearing a recommendation from one of our friends although there is a high price tag it is well worth it considering the caliber of food that you will be eating here this is a great place to go to if you are looking to step outside of your comfort zone and have the chef surprise you also we felt great after the meal even though we were full mainly due to the high quality ingredients that go into this meal overall a great and delicious mealthis restaurant is like no other its housed in a   s greenhouse it s absolutely beautiful and the food is delicious some of the produce is grown on site too the smell of growing tomatoes when you walk into the restaurant is unforgettable you cannot chose individual dishes to eat but you are served the menu of the day with their home baked bread they will accommodate any dietary requirements the staff are charming there is a good wine selection this is a perfect venue for an understated sophisticated celebrationthe food was great and we are glad we took all six dishes even though we were very skeptical of the fresh cheese dish it turned out to be the best one and they were all good service was good attentive and friendly staff thank you benjamin and the rest of you for making the visit enjoyablewe had lunch here and enjoyed true experience immensely there was a set menu but everything on it was very good i opted for the wine pairing and tried some very pleasant wines that matched the food very well every dish was well thought out and prepared using vegetables from their own garden lovely atmosphere and he dining room is much nicer in real life than i thought it would be from the photos will definitely go back when i visit the city again thank yougourmet food and unique surroundings with friendly services fixed menues combined with respect for seasonal ingredients don t miss this restaurant while in amsterdamwe had a truly memorable and exceptional dinner at de kas we are spoiled new yorkers and de kas ranks as one of the best restaurants we have ever eaten at i am shocked to read another reviewer called it pretentious the staff from start to finish could not have been more pleasant and delightful the food was nothing short of superb the setting was exciting this restaurant is not to be missedthis beautiful greenhouse restaurant in the middle of a park was a wonderful find delicious home grown produce on the fixed menu was creatively prepared and presented a little outside of the central amsterdam area but well worth the trip advance bookings necessarythis is one of my favourites restaurants anywhere coming here is more of an event there are two new chefs and you still get the tasting menu but now you can read what u are getting before hand the service as always is very attentive the food was just sublime every course was incredible a feast for the senses we also had an incredible red wine that the sommelier recommend can t wait to go backi heard de kas is a very good option for dinner but i couldn t imagine it s that good food is delicious in a very insteresting location with very kind staff reservation is not easy but it worths one menu two options that s itthis place has really gone downhill we had an extremely disappointing meal last night after having several fantastic meals there in the past the disappointment of it not being up to scratch was magnified i would give it a zero if that was possible tiny portions of weed which i could have picked off the sidewalk with a tasteless dressing for the starter the second dish tasted good but was just like a miniature version of something you might find in the most basic lebanese restaurant served with a fork in a deep bowl which made it impossible to scoop up the final mouthfuls of what was already a pitiful looking amount the main was completely unimaginative again a tasteless sauce and not even cooked properly the same goes for the dessert the rhubarb was sour hard and served with a spoon making it very impractical to eat apparently the concept has changed recently which accounts for the totally different experience to what we had on previous occasions the waiter tried to compensate with free coffees at the end and after asking for it we also got a free after dinner digestif but this is a small token given the extortionate cost for the overall dining experience extremely disappointed we won t be backdespite initial hesitation re capacity four of us sampled six diverse interesting and quite delicious courses over a couple of relaxing and engaging hours i would highly recommend a visit to de kas as a special treati loved every bite i tried on the chef s   course dinner menu it was a great culinary experience and the servers made it extra special the food is what is most memorable and we can honestly say it was one of the best dinners we have ever had a lot of thought was put into each dish and i loved that we could get a peak into the kitchen with the chef working hard i was in amsterdam to kick off my european honeymoon and wanted a special dinner with my husband and they delivered on every aspect the server surprised us with glasses of sparkling wine and a special dessert treat to help celebrate our honeymoon i m so glad i was recommended to go to this restaurant and i highly recommend it the setting was so different than the rest of the city of amsterdam that we were exploring it is located on a green park with its greenhouse right next door after our meal we walked around to look at the nursery and it was cool to see some of the herbs and veggies that were used in our meal freshly plantedthe ambiance and setting are very nice in the restaurant we had   dishes menu but we find it pretty weak in terms of taste and originality the staff is kind but don t know about their wine menu so after all it was okmy friend and i were visiting from the us we were able to book a table for lunch at this amazing farm to table resturant we had the pleasure of zander as our waiter the food along with the wine pairing and explanationfrom zander was outstanding a real fine treatthe location of the restaurant is very tranquil and the decor of the restaurant is really nice and special because you are actually dinning in a greenhouse where they even cultivate their own vegetables and herbs which are also used in the food when fully seated it can be a bit loud as it is just one big space with a high ceiling the service was friendly they only serve one menu the dishes had fresh flavors and were not bad but i expected something more the wine pairing was not so good the wines did not go with the food to well which was a bit of a miss the price quality ratio is in my opinion a bit offexcellent meal from beginning to end very creative ingredient combinations everything prepared perfectly chèvre mousse was one of the best things i have ever eaten in my life very attentive but not overly staff made for a very pleasant evening just do not schedule anything for afterwards as it took a few hourswithout exception this was the finest meal of our recent european trip and one of the best meals we have ever had the setting in a greenhouse in a park sets the mood for the evening the service was friendly and professional the food was sophisticated and deftly prepared mostly from the fresh ingredients grown locally some very locally in the greenhouse itself the wine pairings were flawless i will always remember the beetroot dish the mushroom tea and the goat cheese foam cheese course it was all truly exceptional if you find yourself in amsterdam do yourself a favour and go to de kasthis place is just stunning the restaurant is in a green house with lots of light and just around the back they grow their very own produce the food they served us was so fresh and delicious there s not enough words to describe how much we enjoyed the experience something we also absolutely loved is that you didn t get to choose what you were going to have but instead you were surprised with a stunning dish my friend is vegetarian as well and they were very accommodating highly recommended and worth every pennyhad an absolutely fabulous meal at de kas the setting of the greenhouse was amazing and the service was incredible every course was delicious and although a bit pricey worth every penny we didn t go for the wine pairing but had a delicious dutch gin with tonic it s worth booking at least a month in advance we were lucky enough to get a cancellation reservation the menu is set and there is   or   course options when you have   course the cheese course is usually the one that is left out though we were told if we really wanted the cheese another could be left off we even got some apples when we left which we re grown in the greenhouse it also worth having a little look around the greenhouse afterwardswe are foodies and this was our splurge while spending a week in amsterdam the quality of the food and the sophistication of the preparation was in the top   i ve ever eaten the two chefs are new march   but they arrived from a restaurant that just earned its first michelin star and i understand why the restaurant is fixed menu and they grow the majority of the ingredients at their farm otherwise they source it locally the service was very efficient if not necessarily friendly but i cannot get over how well you could enjoy every spice and every flavor the dishes were sooooo well balancedi decided on the kas which is an old greenhouse that has veen converted into a restaurant the food was amazing and the actual gtounds at night look awe inspiring definitely worth a visit i am only giving them   stars as i feel that there is no signage or info to show you how to get o the restaurant with a car we drove around trying to find it turns out you need to park in the street or take a cab other than that an amazing anniversary eveningwe organised a birthday meal for a friends  st and it was a lovely meal the food was delicious and a really interesting selection of dishesthe restaurant which is in a huge glass greenhouse is stunning the focus is on vegetables some of which are grown on the premises or brought in from farms in the beemster area all of the courses were lovely and the service was attentive the waitstaff describe the components of the dishes in detail it s a bit of a way outside of central amsterdam but well worth the taxi fare highly recommend this restauranti booked this restaurant on the back of the reviews and the fact we wanted to try something a bit different we had booked for     but due to a delayed flight we had to call and push the reservation back over an hour considering how busy they were this was absolutely no problem the staff and service was absolutely superb right from our arrival george in particular made us feel like old friends under his guidance we decided not to look at the   course menu until after we had finished our meal i would highly recommend this as it was wonderful having each course served and really tasting the different flavours and textures a small gap in between each course allowed us to relax and really take our time to savour the whole experience what stood out about the food was how fresh different and delicious it was when thinking about this restaurant it s more than going out for a meal it s the full experience that makes it so special thank you george and the teamwe arrived here on the wrong day of our reservation couse we written down the wrong date luckely we didn t go there for nothing the staff quickly arranged a table for us at the long table where a couple of   with a baby were sitting at the other end we orderd the   course meal and wine parring all the way through the   meals we were possitivly supprised and could only compliment it and went really good with the wine the dish that supprised me the most was the toast with sardin spinach and sennep i must admit im not into sardin or sennep at all and never been a positive experience but this dish was over all expectations and finished it all the best dish we had was duck and spinach soup with had a fantastic texture and great flavour my friend and i ended up getting a tour in the garden we will definitly come back and even might go for chef s tablemost definitely must do in amsterdam way different than other places biological food they even have own farm next to the restuarant excellent ambience the restaurant is located in the middle of the park in the former greenhouse one of the must do in amsterdam the only thing is that they are most of the time fully booked so is good to consider booking at least one month in advancethe former glass house turned restaurant is located in a park we selected the five course set menu each course was just excellent the staff was friendly attentive and were happy to inform us about each course and show us around highly recommendedi cannot say enough good things about this beautiful restaurant what it offers is an experience rather than just good food the tables are inside a lovely large greenhouse and the setting is spare but beautiful just perfect to concentrate on the creative and delicious food that comes from the chefs the waiters are informative friendly but not overbearing or pompous and the food well it must be tasted to be believed set menus focus on seasonal ingredients prepared in exciting and unusual ways and the pairing with the wine tasting menu makes an experience you will never forgetde kas is an experience in itself the effect of sitting in a lofty greenhouse is dramatic however the standard three course dinner including the starter which itself consists of three dishes is also worth going for taste texture presentation are all top class we opted for the wine menu and were not disappointed really good welcoming and attentive staffa wonderful restaurant with excellent attention to detail the food is exquisite and very largely based around vegetables i went with a vegetarian who adored the atmosphere food and very attentive service a must for those visiting amsterdamamazing service deliciuos food and over all the experience is incredible every single plate is a work of art i didnt want to leave the menu is set based on what is available on there farm the day to reserve so be prepared to be surprise and enjoy the amazing atmosphereit s not as central as the other restaurants we went to during our stay in amsterdam but the setting is beautiful and worth the extra stops to get there the greenhouse has been beautifully preserved and looks like a jewelry box from the outside at night some of the food is grown right on the premises we walked through the working greenhouse to see and even taste the lettuces and herbs growing in the winter and the rest is grown at their garden just a couple hundred meters away there are no decisions the chef makes whatever is growing in creative gastronomical ways it was a real experience and the staff was kind and knows their stuff when it comes to winemy family took me here for my birthday celebration and celebrate we did the menu was pleasing and changes with the season they accommodated the gluten free vegetarian and pregnant family members by asking up front what allergies or dietary restrictions we have all the food brought to us was outstanding and service almost impeccable they forgot to bring our wine flight with dinner and had to be reminded also one meal which was supposed to be gf had to be brought back as the garnish had gluten on it we forgive the wait staff for these minor issues but these mistakes reduced the ratings by a notch because my family brought gifts the service realized it was my birthday and brought me a special decorated dessert which was well receivedmy wife took me here as a surprise birthday present and we ate at the chef s table i loved it the food is made with such care and attention the staff clearly love working there i recommend the tasting menu and the accompanying wineswent for a meal on a business trip the greenhouse has many different types of vegetables growing each course you have has a host describing what your eating and how local it is you can also get a tour of the greenhouse lovely place lovely mealwe arrived slightly early for our dinner reservation but we were still accommodated the room is gorgeous warm glowing feeling i have a few allergies which they repeated back to me but sadly missed however the amendments required were hastily made a fabulous and memorable meal had by our family in a beautiful setting well worth the expensegreat overal experience being around for   years this place is one of the best places to include in your amsterdam visit dining in a greenhouse organic food friendly staff as a matter of fact compared to most amsterdam restaurant you are made feeling very welcome and taken care of my party of two had quite a list of food allergies and the chef and it seemed the total serving staff where aware and altered the menu on the spot we where invited to check out the part of the greenhouse where they grow their vegetables amazing i highly recommend this placei choose the place for meeting with our dealers came to amsterdam for ise and it was the right choice excellent service unusual manner of serving dishes no mistakes with food preferencies several vegetarians and muslims it would be a nice place for a business presentation or a party several separated rooms nice views and surroundingswe entered the conservatory and were greeted warmly the meal was a set menu each were complex but masterful flavors i can think of nothing we weren t satisfied with it was top notch excellent in every waywe went with a group at a business trip service was fast friendly and as it had to be the menu as i understood is always set at all times so there is no menu to choose but i am not   sure presentation and taste was excellent i liked the friendly young water we had and the greek cook that presented the menugreat space excellent service and fantastic food if you want a memorable gastronomic experience at a reasonable price this is a restaurant you won t want to misstop notch food but also high prices all the vegetables and fruit are supplied through the kas s own greenhouses around the country the setting is charmingvisits to de kas in a week after trying to dine here for   years it was well worth the wait last week with business colleagues excellent food fantastic wine amarone great atmosphere tonight chef s table experience with my partner to celebrate his birthday thanks to bas aagje alex and all the staff for a truly amazing experience the concept of de kas is fantastic zero kilometre extreme with salads veg fruit grown on site or at their orto just outside the city food quality was truly excellent higher than many starred restaurants we have visited the kitchen was an oasis of calm the welcome was incredibly warm with every staff member giving us a truly friendly experience for the chef s table we arrived with the very first diners at  pm and left   hours later after   courses a guided tour an amazing amount of time with the executive chef bas and memories that will last forever i will reflect later but probably the second best dining experience ever after aqua hong kong can t find more wordsdelicious lunch in a beautiful calm environment a bit expensive and some may complain that there is no choice but it s well worth itde kas was a part of our honeymoon and what a great part it was i emailed them a couple of months before to make sure that the food was tailored for my diet and they were more than helpful when we arrived there it was more than beautiful and there was table reserved for us with an elegant simple romantic arrangement the food was outstanding and so fresh and the dessert was perfectiona very good experience overall the food was extremely smart and unique with tastes that were not revolutionary which was not expecting to blow your mind but make you feel that they thought about each part of every plate very deeply i appreciate when a chef cook wants to feed you not only showoff the service was quite regular the head waiter was a bit petulantde kas is situated in a park and is essentially a giant glasshouse with smaller glasshouses coming off the side these smaller structures have the freshest organic herbs and vegetables growing in them the chicory is grown under dark domed structures the outer gardens grow spring and summer autumn plants but the food exceptional the menu in really three starters and a main using what is fresh and organically and ethically sourced the dishes are both beautifully presented and the textures flavors and combinations put it in the haute cuisine category if there is still space indulge and have dessertthis restaurant is a must for any foodie travelling to amsterdam the service food wine pairing and interior are all breathtaking we enjoyed every bite and even the apples we got to take home as we enjoyed our evening stroll back to our hotel all the produce was beautiful simple and clean we enjoyed being explained the origins of the ingredients sheep s milk cheese duck wine etc really a treasured experiencegreat atmosphere looking at your own vegetables being grown in the greenhouse that you will then eat shortly after and presented in a way that you can t imagine wine pairing was fabulous if you plan to go to ams and you want to eat here make sure you book at least   weeks in advancei got a recommendation you need to make reservation prior to arrive in case is full the place is very nice located in a corner of park frankendael you are literally served in a restaurant of glass like you are in a greenhouse there is no menu the chef will prepare from you a special dish of the week that is prepare with the harvest of their organic fruits and vegetables what i had was just delicious i cant describe the taste but from the starts to desert all just delicious you need to visit the place most of all you knew everything was fresh and just health for your bodyi love this restaurant because they have been pioneering in the way they go about sustainable eating and drinking vegetable lead menu s that are sourced from their own green house first and after that from nearby farmers and growers if we keep growing the amount of people on the planet and if we keep growing the level of disposable income per person then we need to find a way to reduce our footprint the food they serve at the kas is delicious changing daily and served in a beautiful environment it is the example that you don t have to give up anything in terms of experience taste or quality and still be more mindful will definitely come back over and over and will definitely recommend this restaurant to everyonemy husband and i were in amsterdam over thanksgiving week and i had booked dinner at de kas what a charming delightful restaurant a bit out of the way but totally worth it for special dinner all produce grown locally or in the greenhouses which you can visit set menu with no options so you have to be adventuresome eater and they will accommodate you somewhat with advance notice atmosphere was lively inside but you can still talk without shouting the wait staff was so professional our waiter daniel took such good care of us a truly memorable mealyou re eating in a greenhouse with vegetables grown from there it s located in a beautiful park with a storks nest sitting on top of a chimney came on a tues alone got a booking from the day before for    pm place was half full last time we came here we needed to book   months in advance the menu is very different from last time which was just   months ago they only do tasting menu at   three starters main and desert they usually have two mains to choose from you can order both for another   bread was cold no butter olive oil at the table they served tap water when asked today i had a very tender moist fatty guinea fowl breasts served with over a bed of mushroom and sauerkraut excellent combination i suspect it s their pattern in their bird dishes they cook via sous vous then pan fry skin down the dessert was rhubarb with frozen rhubarb yogurt and honey comb crumble wafer to sweeten service was attentive they knew who i was internet is fastyou get to see the veggies before you have a drink before dinner lovely idea to tie people in with their food we had an excellent dinner beautifully presented as we often noted we were served whatever was best that day spacious lovely food and fun views an easy walk to the roadthe location and setting of de kas is undoubtedly lovely but the rest of our experience here was pretty poor the service was terrible we asked for a vegetarian pescatarian set menu and was brought kale and black pudding soup the waiter forgot to tell the chef the replacement kale soup tasted oily the rest of the food was fine but nothing special i can t even remember what it was this place seems to be style over substance at the end of our meal we asked for the bill to which the waitress brought over an empty sleeve we then had to wait fifteen minutes before we could grab the attention of another waitress who then also forgot to bring the bill in total we waited over half an hour to pay the restaurant was less than half full and there didn t seem to be any real excuse for such poor servicethis is an amazing venue with great efficient and friendly service and very good food set menu however i thought it grossly over priced we paid   euros each for three smallish courses carrot cake for pud i make that all the time at home wines very expensive also difficult to get to would not go againon our visit to amsterdam for my  th birthday my husband choose de kas for dinner to celebrate having had the restaurant recommended to us by friends let me say that this restaurant would be a shell of itself if it were not situated so beautifully the glass house is stunning and at night glittered like a tealight in a hurricane vase very romantic the food was good not excellent but good perhaps a little under seasoned and unvaried given the breadth of the produce available to the chefs on their weekly fixed menu i was surprised that it all tasted quite similar there was a distinctive note in each one of the dishes of leafy greens other flavours like the slightly bitter toasted walnuts mineral veal creamy cauliflower and warm burrata were completely lost in the deluge of fresh greens the desert though with the vanilla gelato was sublime ice cold but meltingly smooth conversely the cheese board was again a little same y a selection of sharp mature cheeses i craved a little honey and some mellow soft brie the quince jelly served on the side was mild but not moreish service at de kas like the industrial girders is perfunctory we waited in reception to be seated we waited to be served wine we had to ask what we had been served each course we waited to get our coats we waited to leave hoping that someone might be able to show us around the greenhouse which i had requested by email one week prior to our reservation but we waited and no one appeared so we left would i go again hmmmm probably not no would i recommend you go quite inexplicably yes why not if only to experience a little candlelight flickering off reflective glass with nothing but inky blackness outsidewe had the most amazing evening here during our weekend break to the city we took a tram from our city centre hotel which stopped right at the entrance to the park the restaurant was glowing in the distance as we approached and looked very inviting the staff were very attentive and informative and we were allowed to enjoy our dinner at our own pace each dish was explained to us as it arrived and everything we tasted was sublime you might think it odd not to be presented with a menu but we put our faith in their reputation and we were not disappointed at all the venison dish we had was cooked to perfection and i didn t want it to end every table was busy and i recommend making a reservation well in advance if planning to eat here one of our party had the wine pairing menu too and he enjoyed each and every one you can see some of the vegetables they use being grown in the greenhouse not cheap by any standard but for a special evening it is well worth the price we paid all in all it was a lovely evening and i d love to visit again next time i m in amsterdamafter a short and easy tram ride we arrive to this little oasis just outside of central amsterdam the concept is great they grow there own food and cook according to what is in season it is refreshing to go into a restaurant and the decision of ordering is taken out of your hands the meal was superb service friendly and attentive presentation gorgeous and food deliciousthe location is very nice and the food is very good they grow vegetables on site so you have the chance to see what grows locally alsohad an excellent time here tonight great food and wine and very attentive staff all night the place is nice and spacious unlike many restaurants in amsterdam enough privacy for each tablede kas is a greenhouse restaurant in the middle of an amsterdam city park the menu is designed to use what s grown in the greenhouse right on the premises or nearby where the owners have more acreage to grow large quantities of other produce we enjoyed a fixed price menu for about   euro apiece that included three starters a beet soup another dish with a vegetable new to me that was a combination of broccoli and cauliflower and a salad with a variety of greens the main course was a fabulous pork tenderloin with small medallion of blood sausage and roasted pumpkin dessert was a warm chocolate concoction with a melting center and a dollop of homemade coffee ice cream oh i forgot to mention we started dinner with a gin tonic with a gin made on the premises there are two actually one infused with cloves and orange and another with chili and herbs we went with the former gin and liked it so much we had a second round de kas is a beautiful setting for a wonderful memorable meali visited de kas last week and it was the best meal i have had in amsterdam set in a conservatory the dining area is lovely the service was friendly but not stuffy and the food was greatthis is a great restaurant in amsterdam it was a set menu but they accommodated vegetarians the food was delicious and the setting is wonderfulthis was one of the highlights of our trip the menu consists of whatever the chef wants to bring you that day they are very good with allergens however wonder food very creative presentation as well the restaurant is located inside of a converted greenhouse and is extremely unique and romantictruly great flavoured food simply prepared and well priced crisp clean cooking of the best daily produce creates superb flavours in the class of chez panise in berkeley or nopi in london it is situated inside a garden so great outlook but difficult to locateamazing set menu great staff very friendly and showed us around the garden where they grow the ingredients the atmosphere and the place is vey beautiful and spectacularfor foodies this is a must place to visit while in amsterdam they adhere to the farm to table philosophy for their vegetables and have theirs being farmed on their property where they have several greenhouses menus are chef driven based on seasonal vegetables and are available based on your choice for mains or apps they also have some meat and fish which they source locally so part of your meal will have one or the other it s definitely on the pricey side but part of the experience is their ability to mix and match the freshest vegetables they have at the time and enjoying them at their peak freshness if you re not into veggies you may want to skip this one good experience but as a carnivore it left me wanting more protein at the end of my mealwe booked a dinner at de kas during our stay in amsterdam based on recommendations of a colleague de kas is located in a park which gets pretty dark at night the restaurant itself is beautiful with a huge greenhouse and garden de kas prides itself for using seasonal vegetables and fruit from their own garden in their menu we were promptly seated upon arrival but waited quite a while for the server to come over and explain how the meal works here the meal itself was not bad but not spectacular i thought that the main course of chicken breast with seasonal vegetables was quite a boring dish also the chicken was quite dry the dessert of poached pear with chocolate and granola was pretty good though overall we probably enjoyed the surroundings and tour around their greenhouse more than the food not too sure if i will travel so far to try it again the next timethe whole de kas experience is really wonderful you walk through a lovely park to get to the restaurant and then are enticed by the fresh smells the moment you walk in the door the dining room is radiant with light and life the food was of the best quality and joyously tasty small snafu as my second course never came which was eventually noted i decided to just continue with my main course and a portion of my bill was discounted aside from this minor thing an experience to repeat as often as you are in amsterdamthe gardens are just wonderful while we were walking around chef came out and selected greens for the dinner it is pre fix but they do allow for special requests you really can t get much fresher staff explain each course very well love the building it s like eating in a green house beautiful surroundings of the park reservations are a mustwhat an incredible night the food the service the setting all perfect the restaurant utilizes their garden greenhouse farm to provide the most fresh possible ideas on a set menu if you have one meal in amsterdam go here it is absolutely incredible unique special and lots of fun not much more i can say beyond that other than make your reservation early enjoythis is a nice place first for the location as you can see the small farm of the restaurant where they grow some vegetables second because the food is good if you like veggiesthey are able to cook very unique ingredients some that you may have eaten years ago good wine alsogood serviceladyfriend and i have been here for multiple meals and even reserved their large room for our wedding dinner i will not waste your time describing what this restaurant does and does phenomenally well if you have read even one other review you know that the food is all from their farm or from inside the greenhouse itself that the menu is redesigned daily and that you need only announce your preferences to the waitstaff and they will make it so all i can attest to here is that the food is well just amazing it s probably too expensive and if you ve read the dinner by herman koch you know the clientele but i do have one word of advice do not under any circumstances accept the house cocktail that they offer once you sit down they re like ten euros and it s a mediocre mimosa still if you re going have one expensive meal in amsterdam this should be itthis restaurant is an easy tram ride just out of central amsterdam and well worth finding a fixed menu is offered but the chefs work around any dislikes or allergies the food was very good but not amazing portion sizes adequate service was attentive but not intrusive the setting was extremely pleasant well worth a visitwe had a lovely lunch with friends at de kas restaurant the set menu was very tasty and great variety of dishes the fish as main course was excellent the service was goodwe loved our trip here the ambiance was incredible the wait staff kind and knowledgeable and the food superb i recommend the set menu one of the best experiences i have had overall in a restaurantwe visited on saturday night and loved it the food was incredible the service excellent and all in such a beautiful locationloved this place we had a set menu as we were in a large group the food was great unusual combinations such as a chocolate dessert with basil ice cream a waiter came to explain what everything was before each course which was a nice touch the building is also amazing in a beautiful location in one of amsterdam s many parks highly recommendedthis was the highlight of our stay in amsterdam the food was exceptional you could really tell everything was fresh and high quality it was lovely to walk around the greenhouse where a lot of the fruit and vegetables are grown we spent a few hours here and loved every minute the staff are very friendly and helpful also and could not do enough to help very reasonably priced too considering the quality of the food and service highly recomendedwe ate at de kas during our recent trip to amsterdam this restaurant is truly farm to table they grow all of there own vegetables so it is obvious that they use a lot of vegetables and herbs in their dishes when you get to the restaurant they will have you sit outside in their gardens until they are ready to bring you inside they pretty much have only one seating and everyone has the same prefix meal they will accommodate allergies and dislikes but other than that there is one choice i really recommend the wine pairings as they are very reasonable     euros per person and they pick nice selections for each meal the meal is four courses and you can also get a cheese course after the entree we were very impressed with presentation and the quality of the food and wine the service staff are fantastic and really explain each one of the dishes the use of fresh vegetables and herbs throughout makes the dining experience outstanding the night that we were there the meal was   euros a piece plus the wine pairing which is very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food that you receive this was one of my favorite meals that i have every had and will go again the next time we are in amsterdami haven t been at de kas in quite some years now so was very excited to go back for dinner with a group of friends we were not disappointed we started with a nice bottle of bubbly and a tour of the greenhouses by our great waitress for the evening she was very friendly fast and just great food was outstanding i love their combinations of fresh vegetables and herbs from their gardens with a twist every dish that came out was very well executed and delicious add to that an outstanding selection of wines and we had a perfect dinner i was glad to see that they maintain their high standards after so many years and that a dinner at de kas is still a special treat i will for sure be backto be clear this is good food but is short in terms of price value proposition set menu little choice to change staff was ok i guess we were unlucky with our service lady looked a bit grumpy all the evening happens i guess for this price you get better places in amsterdamtipped off by a friend decided to make a day of it remote on the edge of a park across the amstel river this little corner of heaven awaits your visit the greenhouse grows most of its vegetables on site luckily it was sunny and we ate lunch outside facing the gorgeous flower and vegetable beds edged in boxwood from the moment you sit down the gustatory bliss overwhelmed us the fresh and blended aromas of each course made for an exhilarating experience to be rememberedrun to it bike it uber it but don t miss heaven de kasde kas is a beautiful restaurant set amid a park with its own site specific kitchen s garden and greenhouse from where they source some of their berries greens herbs and so on which is indeed beautiful and emphasises on the restaurants culture of local seasonal products from the wine selection to the actual ingredients in your table the actual restaurant is inside an amazing greenhouse with a small water feature in front the interior space is grand and it has a really nice atmosphere with an open kitchen overall the restaurant offers a good experience in terms of food quality service and quality price standardsfresh farm to table mystery meals created in an all glass green house that is also the restaurant delicious the garden and green house can be toured as well we took the tram from outside centraal station which too about   mins to get there different and a real treat i enjoyed the element of surprise not knowing what was being served at each stagedelicious set meal with   starters a cold soup lobster tail with tomato and melon salad and a board with grilled zucchini eggplant pate greens and cheese a main course we had fish others were eating meat and dessert lovely wine list very attentive and gracious service the setting is very appealing glass roof lots of light sleek furnishings roomythis restaurant prides itself on its bio friendly status they focus on food in season and the results are astonishing the location is lovely in three middle of the park with great views   degreestruly an incredible special experience the restaurant is set in a beautiful greenhouse in the middle of the park a little out of town but we uber d there no problem it s a set menu which changes daily given whatever is fresh there were beautiful wine choices with every pairing the service was excellent i highly recommend this as a special lunch or dinnerdining in an old greenhouse with good climate control makes a very enjoyable and distinctive space food is delicious the menu is set based on season there is an optional cheese plate which looked delicious but we were too full to sample service and presentation were a bit fussy the waitstaff took themselves bit too seriously the meal was pricey   roughly twice our other dinner expenses in amsterdamrestaurant is in a modern greenhouse very similar to the event space in the brooklyn botanical garden in nyc amidst lovely public gardens the food is just as good as the setting meal is a set   course surprise menu which we ve encountered elsewhere in the netherlands they agreed to give me a   course no dessert for a     euro discount i asked for a small light beer and was given a glass of something very good for   euros the food is consciously healthy and light but portions are ample veggies are largely homegrown and delicious we went outside for the sunset and took pictures it was a memorable experienceliving in san francisco there s no shortage of fine dining and casual places but de kas is not really like anything i ve seen here or anywhere in recent memory it s located in a beautiful park the building is a greenhouse and the decor is simple and modern the menu is comprised of a few courses and we opted for the wine pairing each course was delicious clean tasting and representative of amsterdam everything was grown on procured onsite or nearby even the wines we chose were local the staff was friendly knowledgeable and charming worth every penny a lovely experience and definitely someplace i d return to the next time we re in amsterdamthe restaurant is located in a park right beside some of the green houses they use to grow the food you will be eating it can be hot inside if you go on a hot summer day as i did the service is good but expect to be there for over two hours there are no menus they simply bring the food course after course you can tell them if you have allergies or dietary needs but if you are picky with food this is not a place for you our food was good but we got fish and i am not particularly found of fish so that was disappointing the wine selection was good the cheese amazing dessert was average you can ask for a tour of the green houses after your mealeating and drinking a beautiful dinner between a lot of plants flowers and seeds in center town expensive but uniquewas in amsterdam for a short stint and this place came highly recommended space is lovely and the concept of farm to table is definitely nice but obviously not original i had high expectations of food for freshness and inventiveness and food came up short on all counts since menu changes weekly maybe i just came during an off week the marinated beets were nice but the salad of grilled zucchini and eggplant and lettuce were just okay main entree was fish but it was just average in flavor i m all for simplicity that highlights food s freshness and i don t think it delivered there either don t understand all the hype but maybe they had an off weekfrom the unique setting right through to the staff s knowledge of what is being served it is hard not to be impressed by the offering at de kas delicate without being fussy formal yet relaxed we had a memorable evening meal with a flight of wine our server was happy to discuss each course and offered a playful story with each plate that never felt overbearing or stuffy his english was impeccable of course far superior to our grasp of dutch happy to accommodate any dietary preferences bear in mind the menu is created daily i would recommend dining at de kas for a taste of something different and memorableif you are in amsterdam you must go booking needed you do not choose what to eat the menu is choosen daily from the staff based on the best of breath of their cultivated vegetables and their guaranteed vendors excellent experience when i will return to amsterdam i will return to restaurant da kaslast weekend we had a birthday dinner at de kas super beautiful restaurant amazing how they turned a green house in a very modern and beautiful restaurant the service is very friendly and good they work with a set menu so no hassle with making choices you only let them know if there is something you rather not eat the food was delicious and very nicely platted you can walk in through the garden and green house to see the herbs and vegetables they grow locally very cool to see not very cheap but for a specially dinner definitely a place to go tobeautiful setting located about   minutes out of the main city they have uber in amsterdam and it was only a   ride almost all the food is grown on site and was very fresh the menu is set so you don t have many choices other than to modify everything was excellent and the choices made us step out of our usual dishes and try some new things it was fun for our teenager to try something different he found out he actually liked the fish they were servinggreat evening in a stunning setting i highly recommend this restaurant fresh ingredients super wine list and superb settingthis is a beautiful place set in garden area in the city in a glass house where u can walk through and see the vegetables growing the service with a smile is excellent portions are not large but very tasty putting our trust in the choice of what is available thank u for a great nightvery special evening it was earth hour so it was just candlelight in the restaurant the food and setting was superb amazing memories to last a lifetimewhen my friends picked this place to eat i was very nervous firstly i am a very fussy eater and this restaurant doesn t have any menu options you just get what you are given secondly there are some foods that just don t agree with me so i was worried about getting ill thirdly de kas is expensive i am not a fancy food person and was worried about paying for something i would most likely not eat as soon as we arrived in the park where de kas is located i felt like i was in another world the place is gorgeous and is well worth a trip even if you don t eat in this amazing place de kas is fancy and i admit we didn t really fit in but we were treated like all the other guests and there was a welcoming atmosphere my problems with the food aspect were set at ease when the waiter asked if there were any dietary problems that needed to be considered we were three non meat eaters which wasn t a problem and my other two main food problems were noted and accepted with no problem what so ever the food was amazing small portions but extremely tasty i could enjoyed all of it except my main course which had warm grilled tomatoes which i had to leave i just hate them warm no idea why but otherwise it was a joy to eat the surprise menu make sure you ask which dessert there is before deciding if you would prefer that to the cheese board also make sure you walk through the rest of the greenhouse and see all the fresh produce growing right there also make sure you take your credit card or enough cash because the place isn t cheap but it is worth it also you really need to reserve definitely well worth eating here at least once it was a wonderful experiencethe location of this place is awesome in a middle of a park still close to the city center go there for dinner at sunset gets even more magical food is very simple and tasty the quality is in the main ingredients which are grown locally looking forward to come back soonjust returned from a remarkably fine lunch at de kas the greenhouse in the pretty frankendael park on the eastside of amsterdam the restaurant is in fact a spacious and airy greenhouse and it s bordered by its own vegetable gardens but vegetables are also brought in from their farm just outside the city garden flowers too abound it s all very spacious and airy inside and the patio is wonderful as well shaded and with pretty set tables service is quick and efficient but a bit robotic the park and restaurant and also the frankendael manor restaurant a couple of hundred metres away breathe tranquillity de kas serves only set menus that depend on the produce available today for lunch there was a three plate hors d oeuvre among which a wonderful cold summer soup of waddenkrab north sea crab main course was hake merlu grilled to perfection great dessert with tastes of berries and chocolate nice rosé wine and good espressos to top it all off all served prettily by pleasant staffa lovely sunny day in amsterdam made the perfect surroundings for a late lunch in this beautiful restaurant located a little outside of amsterdam city center it has it owns garden and all the dishes have local produce we went for a set lunch menue with wine by the glass our vaitor was very attentive happy and serviceminded the food supertasty the vaitor could introduce every dish and served us champagne and rose wine it felt like a little time out on a nice sunny day this is a sure winner it must be one of the best locations in the city so quiet in the middle of a large gardenpark good food and good wine and off course they a large seating inside on a rainy day reservations is recommended we got to chat a little with our vaitor and it is always nice to talk with someone who is clearly very proud of where she is working the food and ambience clearly reflected that during our lunchbeautiful atmosphere and delicious food i highly recommend this restaurant for foodies and special occasions arrive early for cocktails on the garden patioafter the chaos of amsterdam it was a delight to visit the tranquility of de kas situated in a lovely park surrounded by its vegetable gardens the freshness of all of the ingredients is a delight for your taste buds on the well balanced and thoughtful set menu the wine list is considered and has options for most palates and budgets it was a fabulously relaxing evening during which we were served by knowledgable and attentive staff book well in advance so as not to be disappointedthe venue itself is quite a nice place it is unique and comfortable we were in the main open room only had the choice of a   course menu so you do not get to choose food was very basic in it majority with lots of small plant looking things to make the dish look exciting for me it was very plain under sized and overrated a small piece of fish for the main this place is certainly for the people that are foodies and dont mind spending alot of money for a small amount of food in an exclusive environment the service was good apart from a long delay in getting our  rd course i can see how people would love this place but its just not my style an experience for a special occasion for the average person i suspect something i certainly would go to the effort of trying againwe loved our visit at de kas in amsterdam a short trip on out rented bikes to get to de kas in the middle of a park we walked around the nursery and the garden from where the restaurant are provided with their fresh vegetables the food was perfect and the surroundings matched this wonderful experience go there if you are in amsterdamrestaurant de kas offers a menu at a fixed price which is a very good idea and a fine way of letting the chef do his magic and decide the courses from the availability of the produce and ingredients i don t think it worked however the day we visited the restaurant it was a fine and beautiful day during the first week of july and i visited de kas with my husband for dinner around   o clock for starters we had parsley soup and after that a dish of mackerel the parsley soup was a bit bland i would call it with a weak taste of parsley and shredded salad in the bowl not impressive the plate with mackerel was a serving of smoked mackerel served on a block of cucumber with some fresh greens around it i am not sure that smoked mackerel and cucumber do anything good for each other in a culinary sense at least in this case they didn t the main course was chicken served on a bed of salad and some mashed potatoes there was nothing extraodinary about it the best thing of the meal was actually the desert which was some fruit based ice cream served with a lovely cream berries and meringue the setting in a greenhouse is great fun and the service is impeccable no doubt about that mindful and friendly we ended at a price of   euros which isn t bad when you consider what you can end up paying at other culinary establishments except i don t think that de kas lived up to that kind of expectations that nightthe restaurant for lunch offered a prix fix menu chef s choice but it was amazing the restaurant is pricy but the value is exceptional everything was so very fresh and delicious and service was tremendous it is located in east amsterdam so is a cab ride it s in a park and beautifulde kaz is a must beautiful food beautiful surroundings and great service fresh local food made specially each day it is a little pricey but definitely worth the expensebeautiful location nice service and lovely food reserve your table by phone or e mail the booking on the website is rather unstablewe had great     course dinner there i mostly was surprised and enjoyed my desert which was beetroot based it is better to reserve in advanceinteresting meal no menu as they just bring what they grow on site   courses and all flavorful   euro prix fix off the beaten path about   minutes outside of the cityde kas is a place one has to visit to believe it the setting is more like a green house in the middle of a park we sit amidst greenery i won t do any justice by saying a few words here we were a vegetarian group and they made unreal food for us on pre request though everyone may not have a pallette for such food it s still worth a visitmy boyfriend and i enjoyed the   course lunch with bottle water but paid   euros for it it was good food light and fresh soup salad and fish but certainly not worth   euros we would have paid   or   euros total it s a unique experience eating in the modern glass structure and there was great service but for better bang for the buck i would eat again at brasserie ambassade where we paid   euroswe came for dinner and it was fantastic from the first course to the last byte of the desert an unforgettable experience and in my case   gluten freeorganic and just grown in the green house by this stunning glass roofed restaurant in a scenic park just   minutes from amsterdam and well worth the trip delicious and unexpected we loved the changing coloured lights and the wine pairing excellent and unexpected food combos buzzy and fun highly recommendedi went to this restaurant with two friends at lunch we reserved long time before and we had very high expectation too bad the service was awful very long we stayed two hours for a very light lunch we took two menus with three starters each and two main courses to share but the portion are ridiculous at the end of the lunch we were starving and we didn t have time to order anything else the food is not a big deal a starter was composed of three small carrots that s it the location is beautiful but the price is very high it wasn t worth it never againeven been skeptical going to a restaurant with a fixed menu this was a very nice surprise great combinations all they are cooking is seasonal and they change the menu every wednesday depending of what they harvested the week before really creative placefor anyone in the mood for a wonderful tasting menu made of obviously fresh quality food that everyone in the group will want to eat de kas is your place the menu continuously varies on the produce of the day ensuring a variety of fresh and seasonal vegetables alongside beautiful cooked meats or of course more vegetables if you chose their delicious vegetarian menu food worth its valuei was treated to dinner here by our host company the service was slow and the food was experimental dishes are constructed based on ingredients available that day the waitress sophia found it tricky waiting on a table of english people and so we ended up drawing a table plan with what we would and would not eat on it she wasn t aware of the drinks available and they didn t have a drinks menu they have a wine list either so the blind were leading the blind dishes eaten awful vegetarian soup like baby food awful haddock starter with nice beets overcooked hollandaize new potato with undercooked spring peas how could you mess this up at this price overdone pork with chorizo samphire fried gnocchi and a repulsive anchovy which did not complement the food and an excellent chocolate brownie dessert barring the pickled watermelon all in all a piss poor experience if you want an honest meal without pretention i was glad to not have paid and i won t be backthe building and surroundings are beautiful peaceful and the gardens surrounding are immaculately tended for the food for lunch is different each day based on what is growing at the time and meats or fish are paired with a theme the chef s come up with each day for lunch it is a   course meal with a small bowl of roasted beats and olives to munch on before the courses begin the special was a white fish but my husband was also able to have something different as he is not a fan of white fish they came up with a small chicken and fixed it on the spot for him the colors presentation and flavor of all the fresh combinations were excellent we are recommending to friends to go there must have a reservation apparently dinner needs to be about   months in advance but the lunch spaces were there if you go on their website one of the staff took pictures of the chef s kitchen and a picture of our dishes that we had for lunch super sweet and happy groupthe space is gorgeous and feels very modern and different as you walk in you see the beautiful beds of flowers and vegetables they grow at the restaurant the food is artfully presented and very very fresh this is farm to table cuisine which is a very popular and positive trend at the moment the service was a little slow we had to ask for bread and the wine service was slow also but the servers were friendly and pleasantwe really enjoyed it here the fact the veg is grown on site is a nice touch the staff were a cool and friendly team the food was delicious we went on a tuesday evening and it was packed so book ahead not central but worth the cab ridewent here for lunch one day and it was amazing all locally sourced ingredients from their personal farm all dishes were focused more on vegetableshad supper with a group of twenty five customers and colleagues menu is mostly grown and raised on site the concept of self supply is unique most importantly the dining experience and food with wine were excellent the menu is limited however this seemed to help speed up the service worth repeatingi remember this place from   years ago when i visited few times and i remembered it as one of the best restaurants in amsterdam therefore i had really high expectations and oh gosh was i disappointed we got a set menu with   dishes   starters one main and one dessert or a cheese the food was just ok nothing more portions are extremely tiny and the whole atmosphere was of people coming outside of amsterdam for a night out the place had zero atmosphere everybody got the same food bad service even the bread was not tasty and the most outrageous thing is that we went to a tapas restaurant close by pata negro as we were still hungry never happened to me that i went to a restaurant paid   euros per person and came out hungry bottle of wine   set menus and a bottle of water don t go there this place is so overrated and enjoying still the reputation it had in the past i am eating out regularly and this was by far the worst experience i had in a long time do yourself a favour and find yourself some other place to eat amsterdam has many good to excellent restaurants nowadays this one is definitely not one of themfrom the moment you walk in this place you smell the freshness of the food a three course meal with perfect wine pairing this is a must visit the broad bean soup the white asparagus and deep fried octopus salad the guinea fowl and the amazing watermelon peach sorbet desert was perfect it would have been nice if the servers gave more details on the wine instead of just saying this is the wine from so and so country hope you like it the ambiance was homey and relaxingwe have been many many times and it is still one of our favorites a little sad to see the greenhouse areas changed and smaller but service and food remain the same excellentthe restaurant is really cool with it s own greenhouse food was good but a little expensive for the quality and what you get served staff was good and attentative worth a visiti loved this restaurant for everything from the amazing food an explosion of flavors to the location the concept of having their own vegetable garden makes the difference in every served dish and you can taste iti came here for my anniversary dinner three days ago while traveling to amsterdam with my boyfriend we got an early reservation so we could continue exploring the night sights of amsterdam the whole concept of having no menu was very interesting and new to me and i really enjoyed the surprise of just being brought out food the wine list was very good had a nice range of reasonably priced and fancier wines for those who were so inclined we decided to get two glasses of wine as part of the food pairing a very nice white and a red that was a hybrid between a rose and a classic red each course was something i may not have considered ordering traditionally off of a menu if i saw it but i thoroughly enjoyed every one food was beautifully presented and had a great mixture of flavours the service was exceptional everyone seemed to have a very good awareness of what had gone into the food all in all for quality of cooking like this and such a beautiful dining experience de kas is incredible value for money we had a lovely evening and would recommend it to anyone traveling to amsterdamits a very nice place with a unique setup of like greenhouse cuisines prepared by fresh food items from their own garden a must place to visit if you like the chef to satisfy your taste buds visited febwe loved our lunch at de kas sitting on the patio with a great view of the gardens beyond was a real treat the staff were great and took time to explain the philosophy and history of the restaurant the food was beautifully presented and tasted amazing all in all it seemed like great value and a genuinely unique experienceit was a beautiful day to be having lunch on the terrace our server explained that the chef had chosen the day s menu for our three course lunch when we said there were a couple of things we would rather not eat he assured us the chef would adjust accordingly the first two courses came fairly quickly and were delicious then there was a long wait we ordered another glass of wine and enjoyed watching the storks who had nested on a nearby chimney feed their young the restaurant was not crowded but still we waited just at the point that we decided to order coffee and give up on the main course it arrived the fish was perfectly cooked and the accompaniments fresh and flavorful this restaurant is not to be missed just be ready for a leisurely unique experiencetook my son here as a treat today the menu is decided beforehand fortunately they ask if there is anything you don t like the portions were a good size and we felt full some interesting food combinations however the gin and tonic was a horrendous price do not have mixed drinks the service was excellent and the situation lovely and different the park is great to walk through afterwards and see the local allotments it was quite expensive but not ridiculously so considering how much we had paid in other ordinary restaurantswe caught a no   tram from centraal station to the front door it was a brilliant spring day and on arrival we were offered a table outside the glasshouse adjacent to the hedged vegetable garden great ambience pleasant staff the menu is set and restricted to what is available and fresh all their own produce this was the freshest and most refreshing meal we have had for a long time highly recommendedin defense of this beautiful location it must be noted that the menu changes daily so always call ahead otherwise you ll get something you probably dont like or might not eat still its very nouveau and experimentali have bbeen here for a wedding and the organization was fantastic having aperatives in the garden was charming the staff is very customer oriented very keen on satisfying your needs the food is well prepared and very good a restaurant to be reccomended for surebook in advance find the time to go and you won t be disappointed excellent food conscientious staff great experience not to be missedtook the tram and got dropped off practically at the doorstep of de kas a farm to table restaurant extraordinaire it took about an hour and a half to go through the meal with wonderful service and even though it was drizzling the views were lovely through the glass walls walk through the gardens after the meal to see what you have just been eatingmy mother and i went to de kas for a late mother s day lunch while she was visiting me here in amsterdam we had a wonderful lunch with fresh vegetables and were happy to see they could accommodate a tasty vegetarian option food varies and the menu is based on what is seasonally grown in their garden lots of light and airy atmosphere reservations for lunch at least seemed to fill up quickly so i would check a few days in advance to ensure you get a spota very special restaurant with a great concept excellent food and inspiring atmosphere great roof garden and very friendly servicecelebrated my wife s birthday and it was a memorable meal beautiful location in a greenhouse setting service impeccable and food yummyvery fun environment for both big groups or couples alike menu changes depending on the season and food that is grown locally delicious i had the lamb and my wife had the fish fish was the better of the two dessert was outstanding lemon cake raspberry sorbet and a white chocolate cheesecakevery enjoyable wonderful atmosphere fresh food and and a very good set menu they accommodate food preferences and allergies but otherwise the entire menu is fixed creative farm to table delicious food in a lively atmosphere perhaps a little loud is a small complaintwe went to de kas recommended by several guides in may   location nice location a greenhouse near a little lakeatmosphere silent no sparks extremely simple and coldservice the staff is kind and smiling food awful we had dirty hot water of cabbage salads one with three crumble of feta two smaller salad with a small sad piece of lobster one salad with pork ribs and a small sausage as main course with a crumble of potato roasted many hours before as it was gummy cheese selection at   eur with   pieces of three bad cheeses with rhubarb dessert rhubarb cakeprice more than   eurcomments more than   chefs to make   salads main course awful as it was cold rough and the only potato was old as it was cooked many hours before  eur for a poor selection of cheesethere are many vegetables in nature why do they select only the untasty and sad oneswe visited de kas whilst travelling through europe on our honeymoon it was our chosen treat meal whilst in amsterdam the setting of this gorgeous restaurant was beautiful the set menu was nice and our server was lovely nice restaurantit was a great setting for our first night in amsterdam wonderful concept of green house setting for a business group meals with exquisitely prepared and service was also wonderfully orchestrated for   peoplewhat a wonderful experience we had at this spectacular greenhouse restuarant the tasting type menu is provided for you in courses they only ask what you cannot eat or any allergies then you must submit yourself to a sublime experience of the freshest herbs vegetables grown right there at the greenhouse each course is the right delicate amount to surprise your tastebuds they will offer wine selections to go along with each course this is a true foodie adventure when they offer a handmade cheeseboard with dried fruits and nuts as dessert i am in heaven a must do experience for the food adventurergood tasty and healthy food they serve freshness and a lot of herbs to surprise your taste they grow a lot of the herbs they serve in a gazebo inside the restaurantde kas was wonderful   years ago and we looked forward to a return visit unfortunately this time around the set menu had a terrible soup mediocre salad and a slice of pork that could have been mass produced for a cafeteria style meal the couldn t care less server announced the pork as veal one of us preferred fish and the same bland sauce was poured on both couple all this with ordinary wines and high prices and you have a pretty terrible experience really de kas has simply turned badi have eaten here for about   years ago last time in amsterdam and wanted to try it again while visiting the city and it was a good choice it was still as good as i remembered it the staff is laid back and friendly without getting to close the dishes were very tasty and felt fresh probably because of the fact that there was a lot of fresh vegetables i also didn t find it that expensive i have eaten at other restaurants where you d get one dish for the same price as a   course dinner here and those restaurant has not been nearly as good don t have any complaints what so ever will definitely come back here when i m in amsterdam next timede kas is a beautiful and interesting dining experience the menu changes everyday and is based on what is fresh that day and what the chef feels like cooking and presenting you really don t have a say in the matter but it really doesn t matter because everything was delicious well prepared well seasoned and well presented a bit pricy but worth itan amazing choice for a diner with your lover future or current located in east amsterdam the menu comes at a fixed price and you cannot choose the surprise will not be disappointing enjoy a nice enchanting diner in amsterdamwhile the restaurant is located in a beautiful setting the food was disappointing for the price my boyfriend and i were visiting amsterdam and made a reservation here we both had the chef s menu which offered fresh ingredients in reasonable portions but overall the food was a bit bland it certainly wasn t worth the   tabwould go back when in amsterdam the food is absolutely delicious and the wine selection is very nice the restaurant itself is very beautiful set up in a glasshouse with very elegant and original decor staff is very friendly and accommodating if you want to go you need to reserve in advance will go back for surewe started off in the lovely gardens with an aperitif on a beautiful sunny evening the welcome is warm and friendly and care is taken to explain the restaurant s formula a surprise menu of four or five courses although you can of course mention any foods you can t eat vegetables and herbs are grown in their own gardens and the menu was iight fragrant tasty and healthy good advice on accompanying wines we loved it need to book well in advance to secure a tableno menu just what the chef feels like doing during the day all the vegetables are grown on site in luscious garden behind restaurant best salads and steak tartar i ve had in years definitely recommendedlong story short we had a seat at the chefs table some friends ate here last year what can i say   courses paired with interesting wines sitting in the kitchen with all the chefs fun food more fun more food wonderful in every respect each chef brought out a dish prepared for us explained what how and why this restaurant is a farm to table eatery they use the herbs flowers vegetables to season their foods it is artistic interesting and delish i ve never had a     hr meal wow wow wow everyone from the time you stepped into the restaurant until you left you are specialthe ambiance is lovely we ordered a glass of rose so that we could enjoy the views before it came we received a small dish of olives and marinated celery root and mushrooms we were there less than   minutes when the first course arrived i could tell it was not going to be a leisurely lunch the white asparagus soup was very good and nicely presented while i was in he bathroom they served the salad i have never heard of a plate being served when the person has left the rest of the meal followed suit they tried to remove my husband s dish while he was in the bathroom and i was still eating so much for a leisurely lunch by the way they did not ned the tablewe ate here on our first night in amsterdam and it was tip top it s a really cool building literally part of the greenhouse where much of their food is produced we were able to have a little look around the produce before sitting down to eat the food was really inventive and we treated ourselves to the accompanying flight of wine all food was presented by knowledgeable and friendly staff although it s quite a high end restaurant the vibe is very relaxed a must go for foodies travelling to amsterdamafter reading many restaurant reviews in advance of a brief stay in holland my wife and i selected dekas for our first dining experience in amsterdam and our expectations were exceeded the beautiful restaurant is located within a large contemporary greenhouse and is surrounded by a pretty park just a short tram ride   from centraal station dekas is easily accessible from anywhere in the city the gorgeous surroundings enhanced an amazing chef s menu of fresh delicious appetizers entrees and desserts each course was expertly prepared with dishes that were too beautiful to eat the fresh locally sourced ingredients combined for a most flavorful meal the wine list provided many good options and the service was exceptional every member of the staff was courteous professional and very proud of their restaurant we ve enjoyed many great meals in europe and highly recommend dekas to anyone seeking a memorable dining experienceas i go there since they opened somewhere around   and returning every time i visit amsterdam i am delighted to say that the place is still wonderful charming maître d efficient and courteous staff delightful food and beautiful wines oh yes as my sister has severe gluten and lactose intolerances poor her they gave a twist to her dishes so she would not be bothered afterwards fact the maître d even remembered it before we could mention it still recommending de kas to our friends visiting amsterdam and no one was disappointed of their visit again congratulations to de kas of keeping up the quality and the friendliness can t wait to come backi was brought by a friend and had no idea of what to expect so the whole thing was a great suprise go with friends or someone fun to keep it from getting too stuffy as the locals clearly think it s a bit of high spot and are all well turned out and a tad formal fortunately the venue is big bright contemporary and really stylish all their food is grown either within their greenhouses or on their farm or locally and it s al about what s ripe for picking the combination of flavours are fab you get what you re given so you just have to go with the flow the food is vibrant and full of freshness which really pop even the greens local arugula micro herbs are lively on the tongue and i ve never enjoyed rhubarb so much it s refreshingly different great for an occasion as top end price point but really worth itin a glass green house located somewhat away from the tourist area it is around    mins walk from the amstel metro station inside a park we enjoyed the lunch there spacious friendly and efficient service food presentation and taste were both good i think diners get the most out of the glass house ambiance at lunch but i have not eaten there at night two set lunches and two glasses of wine cost euro     recommendedlovely place good energy and lots of fresh things book chefs table for the best expirience fine place to be and worth to visitlocated inside a park the restaurant building is a glass greenhouse very beautiful it s a single     course menu according the season the chef s philosophy is to serve fresh food locally grown and harvested vegetables from local farmers the service staff is very attentive the food is very good great experiencealthough the restaurant setting is lovely in a converted green house in a park setting we were disappointed in the food which is grown in the restaurant greenhouse they asked if anyone had allergies and were told that our granddaughter was allergic to peanuts then they served her a sauce that contained peanuts and she had a serious reaction on the pretentious sidethe restaurant is housed in a green house it s a unique ambience but the food was not great service was okay but not exceptionalsome friends who visit amsterdam regularly recommended this restaurant to us and we were really glad that we followed their advice from beginning to end it was a very special meal that we will always remember and talk about each dish was explained in detail and tasted amazing although you are asked if there are any foods you don t like you don t actually choose your dishes from a traditional menu but are served the very best in season produce i loved this idea and it meant that i didn t spend the evening wishing i d chosen the dishes my husband had picked the food was beautifully presented and was absolutely delicious the staff were attentive but not stuffy and were happy to answer any questions we had it is a little way away from the centre of amsterdam but easily reached by a   minute tram ride or taxi it was a unique experience and we will definitely go back next time we re in amsterdaman ideal restaurant to me interesting and delicious food attentive and friendly service no arrogance comfortable setting reasonable price de kas delivered on all of these we had a great evening experiencing taste combinations we have never experienced enjoying the climate controlled greenhouse setting and being made to feel very welcome we made reservations well in advance and i am glad we planned for this dinner most definitely worth a special trip be aware there is no menu you eat what they are preparing no complaints here five enthusiastic starsyoung couple went for dinner as this place sounded interesting and my partner s very into being green lovely place good service excellent food very expensive but a lovely meal out free cloakroom for coats very clean open kitchen area you can see where your food is grown prepared and served which is pretty coolwe had a wonderful lunch here de kas serves home grown in season vegetables which are the star of the show our set menu did contain some fish but the focus is obviously on the veggies whilst there isn t a menu to choose from it s a blind set menu the staff went out of their way to accommodate a food allergy with really incredible substitutions we were also asked if we had any food dislikes so i don t think anyone would really struggle to eat here the meal started with tiny plates of pickles and bread to share we then had a bowl of delicious onion broth followed by roasted vegetables in a nutty dressing and bulgur wheat with clam the main was fish with root vegetables in a herb sauce we had cheese all dutch varieties and then an incredible raw chocolate brownie for dessert we opted for the matching wines and we weren t disappointed i d especially recommend the dutch sparkling wine we found the staff to be fantastic i had mentioned it was my partner s birthday when booking and they certainly made it feel like a special occasion the service was great the kitchen also iced the dessert plate with a birthday message which was lovely and unexpected the dining space has a great ambience in the daytime sadly the weather was awful so we didn t get the chance to look around the park gardens but it was nice to be able to look in the greenhouses on the way out i d certainly return here the food was great the staff were lovely and helpful and i d love to see what it is like in the summeri think the location is very nice and perfect spot for a date or business event service was excellent as well friendly fast and knowledgeable the food wasn t bad it just didn t match the rest of the experience especially at this price i wouldn t go again and would only suggest it to people who are in for the experience atmosphere and primarily the foodthis was really excellent experence the atmospher with excellent service the food is healthy and freshnever eaten anywhere like it however was food great not sure we went here on the back of a   day holiday to the carribean and have to say in all honesty i have had a lot better waiters were pleasant enough but very stiff really did not get this and our teenage kids had mcdonald s after as even the pasta kids meal really did not cut the mustard if you want a great location to meet with friends this is the place the rest is just a little to pretentious for our tastesthis was a birthday meal for my partner and our first time eating at a restaurant with a fixed menu was a little dubious to start with but felt completely at ease once the waitress had talked us through what to expect that evening we really enjoyed   out of   starters but that was due to personal taste of not being fans of fennel the main was delcious we followed this with a cheese platter as suggested by the waitress prior to our dessert on which the chef wrote happy birthday on the plate which was a nice touch we had the table from   until about   ish and were not rushed or pressured at any point the greenhouse itself is beautiful both inside and out and we had a fabulous experience made all the better by the friendly and efficient staff would recommend for a special occasionthe setting is beautiful but we were very disappointed with the food i am vegetarian and i had a very average meal from the salad to dessert my friend who ate the fish also felt the samethis was the  th time i had dined at this restaurant and  nd time at the chef s table the service was impeccable the food all   courses were delightful and the chefs in the kitchen made the who enexperience come to life their passion for the food they served was inspiring i will come here every time i am in amsterdam simply wonderfulate here last june and was blown away crazy good beautiful environment returned in march and the best i can say the place looked great the food was ok totally adequate nothing wrong but certainly didn t meet my expectations nothing memorable not the food not the wine not the cheese save it for the summer monthslunch in a near empty big glass house in a park service self important server who assured us they are almost full most nights for dinner delivered water and then wandered around speaking with the other server and kitchen staff for almost fifteen minutes before returning only one choice of first course main course server did not tell us about alternatives which we heard other server who seemed to be nicer telling the only other table in use we asked our server for an alternative at which she took umbrage grudgingly said that would be possible and finally after i said could not eat the offering agreed with great reluctance the food great lettuce and micro greens fair turnip grown in their own green house and garden the guinea hen and perch on the other hand were pedestrian dull and overcooked another preciously narcissistic organic with mediocre cuisine not worth the tram ride much less the menu pricedinner with a friend at restaurant de kas in amsterdam was a very pleasant surprise the chef only uses fresh and seasonal products and grows his own vegetables in de kas greenhouse the food was very tasty and the presentation lovely three small starters very delicious and a main course mine was vegetarian my friend took fish everything on the plate was eatable even the flowers and it was all great the dessert was the same for both of us tasty too but my favorite was my main dish photo with flowers on the placewell we went there on lunch with friends the staff is very friendlythe moment we went in we were well greeted and guided to our seats the waiteress informed us that there is no menu its just what the chef is cooking and we just had to inform them about allergies or any food we don t like and we did the food was so good the place is very nice highly recommendedvery fancy place with excellence service organic food grown on their own lands was delicious it was pretty expensive but a big part of this was due to the fine wine and very nice local wodka definitely the fanciest restaurant i have visited in amsterdam yetbritish couple abroad celebrating a birthday staff were wonderful and friendly and the food as we expected was fabulous the staff went to great lengths to adjust their fixed menu for a dairy allergy the large greenhouse venue was very special and unusual and a key part of the restaurants unique atmospherehighly recommended for a more special perhaps civilised personal or business lunchwe had a lovely friday lunch sampling the tastes of des kas they were fully accommodating to my food intolerances and the food didn t suffer in flavour because of this the whole concept is great and the service alongside was as well it wasn t too expensive for the type of food and service you got therefore for value for money i think that it was on pointthe best in amsterdam a must visit location is out of the way but worth the trip fresh and accessible food great wine and cocktail listthis lunch was a real treat indeed the food was not only delicious but also very innovative and beautiful the environment in the restaurant also adds something very special to your dining experience their range of vegetarian food is better than almost every restaurants which is appreciated by us vegetarians this was by far the best meal we had in amsterdam and i really recommend this restaurantthis was an interesting place and just as described even offering a small tour of the greenhouse it is not an a la carte restaurant as it only offers   courses of local sources food available that day all three of ours were delicious soup for starter then two small dishes of roasted fennel in filo and the other mushroom turnip and purees the main dish was cod with roasted pickled and pureed carrot yummy we then had a lovely set of cheeses we opted for the wine pairing and had lovely and interesting wines with each course the place was big but had a nice hubbub atmosphere an added bonus is that it is right next to the no   tram stopin this unique location was treated to dinner by my daughter an excellent idea of home grown locally sourced ingredients the fixed menu was explained in great detail and took into account my   allergies excellent taste and unusual presentation and preparation dried crispy vegetables mushroom broth like no other however we did feel that we did not get total value for money coming in at approx   euros a head first of all some of our group were still a little peckish even after the set courses another downside was the service it starts off too enthusiastically and then tends to die down the nearer you ge to bill time we had to ask   waiters and wait   minutes for the bill in summary interesting cuisine yes but not worth the expensea group of us had lunch here some of the group were vegetarian and others were not everyone had a fantastic meal the restaurant is set in a glasshouse they grow most of the produce they use and the staff explain each dish as its being served the food was outstanding and the service was friendly fluid and unpretentious we all loved itde kas is a little way out of the centre of amsterdam but easily accessible by taxi or the number   tram it is situated in a beautiful large high ceilinged conservatory surrounded by home grown vegetable and herb plants there is a set menu every day of   or   courses or just   starters if you would prefer the flavours in each dish are complex and unusual beetroot features quite a bit very healthy the portions are small but we were pleasantly satiated by the end of the meal you can opt for paired wines or choose from the wine list this is an experience worth indulging ini booked the chef s table during my honeymoon for my wife and i it was the last dinner on our european trip and it could not have ended any better from beginning to end the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a great time we had a private table in the kitchen where we were able to watch the kitchen prepare food the entire night each chef took a few minutes to present and explain each dish they prepared for us   courses too we also were provided wine pairings throughout the night that made it even more fantastic at the end of our meal experience   hours but it flew by because of the great time the head chef gave us a tour of this lovely restaurant and their philosophy behind their creations they create menus weekly and always use fresh local ingredients some of which are grown right at the green house overall a fantastic experience and i would highly recommend de kas to anyone looking to have a romantic informative and fun experience book the chef s table it won t disappointso in all honesty i had heard so much about this place that i went in with very high expectations and it did meet quite a few food the food is fresh creative and delicious you can tell how fresh and lovely the produce is given that they grow it themselves full   points for the food the service was attentive and quite good too where it fell short was the vibe of the place we went on a friday night and i was expecting warm lively evening but the place was a little empty and the decor was a litte off with pink and blue lights and the ambience didn t feel cozy and warm for a winter dinner would i go here again yes but only to see how it is in the summer i can imagine how it can be perfect for summer lunches and even dinners but it didn t cut it for a winter warm cozy romantic eveningwe went for an evening meal travelling by tram you arrive to see the lit greenhouses across a lit bridge a great entrance the food and service were faultless really good food and for a michelin starred restaurant good value too the staff were really friendly and helpful hard to faultvery interesting venue yes in a working greenhouse and the food was incredible clearly they are experts at serving vegetables they grow but everything was really goodi know i know they grow some of their own produce and de kas is located in a wonderful green space bla bla bla the soup was super the rest was super average we ordered the set   course they served the main straight after the first course they tried to make up for it by serving us a cheese platter after the main but got that wrong as well by serving a portion for one not for two they swapped the cheese platter before my dinner date returned to the table they did not charge us for our off the list wine in an attempt to make up for an otherwise average experience even with the hiccups aside with the exception of the fresh soup de kas serves average dishes don t believe the hypede kas which means greenhouse in dutch is an absolute treat when they say farm to table they mean it you ll enjoy your meal in a greenhouse that serves as part of the facility where they grow all the vegetables you will eat the food is beyond fresh if that s even possible and the flavor of everything is unadorned with sweeteners salts or fats no menu which may seem odd at first but also simplifies the choices you have to make sit back and let them bring out delicious and healthy foods that will continue until you are full oh you can select your beverages of choice before during and after your mealwe went here with another couple and enjoyed every morsel of every dish the menu is fixed in advance we had the wine pairings with the meal which added to the immense pleasure of the dishes the service was first classfirst of all it s beautiful it s set in a greenhouse and feels and looks amazing the food is great you tell the chef what you don t like to eat and get a   course meal that is absolutely greatnice place inside a beautiful park at amsterdam good gourmet food and wine harmonization i strongly sugest for everyoneorganic food with an excellent combination of ingredients the olives served as starts are impressive big and delicious the only bad thing is the dark hair lady that makes the service in the main lobby second time i go there and she is very arrogant and attends with attitude i just returned for the foodwe loved our dinner at this restaurant i would usually avoid anywhere that has a fixed menu but took a gamble on this one i am very pleased i did as the food was excellent for both vegetarians and others the service was great and the cost was reasonable it was also very interesting to see the greenhouse where much of the food was grownfantastic setting inside a huge glass orchard inside a charming private park you arrive by a short path in the middle of trees and water ponds inside there is also a nice chimney fed with wooden pieces stored along the wall quite elegant yet not formalin a greenhouse a     min taxi ride from the center this was a visit to a restaurant recommended by family members recommended for its approach to short travelled food we had the set menu the only one   courses with matching wines the wines were a mixed experience after a quite surprising good sparkling dutch riesling before the meal we had other locallly produced wines some not up to the standard and matching the quality of the food we expected service and ambiance were great and the restaurant must be a wonderful place in the springtime in the middle of the parkafter much hype about this restaurant we were excited at the prospect of a interesting meal created with care from the green house garden and locally sourced products however this was not ot be the case fo us we dined for dinner friendly service team seated us and explained the concept of de kas a   course set menu for     euros plus plus plus we decided on the wine pairing to complement the menu a further     per person first course was a earthy clear mushroom soup with a foam so the soup looked like a frothy beer quite bitter in taste however palatable second course was a salad of green house greens poached salsify crisp vegetables lightly smoked piece of salmon with a red pepper and galric dressing this course was very pleasant to the palate and enjoyed by all second plate was a salad of winter cabbage caramelised pear blue cheese on a crostini of walnut bread a strange combination of crisp fried cabbage blanched cabbage sweet pear and tangy cheese mmmm different main course was a juicy guinea fowl breast set on champ potatoe brocolli flowers braised endive and poached rhubard and a guinea fowl jus i was not taken by the range of the different flavours too many that just did not marry together the red wine did not pair well at all too young and hard on the palate we chose the cheese platter of   dutch cheeses apricots and a syrup walnut bread the portions of cheese were so miniscule it came as such a suprise to see how much lack of love and attention to detail dessert was a apple tart tatin filled with marzipan paired with a egg nog ice cream no caramel sauce from the baking process leaving the dessert somewhat unappetising overall we found the food dining experience less than optimal for a restaurant with so much standing in the city sadly it lacked the wow effect which we did not expect after reading up on the internet about iti keep getting drawn back to this place the food is fantastic all natural ingredients produced on site or at one of their local farms the menu is fixed depending on what in season but in the many times i have been there i have always been impressed they can cater if you have any allergies or dislikes just make sure you tell them great venue for either a date or business dinnerwe went to this restaurant expecting something great which unfortunately didn t happen the setting is very nice the waiters are polite but the food is just far beyond disapointing no taste no originality tiny portions just plain boring thanks god the bread and wine were good other restaurants in amsterdam offer a far better food for lessthis is fine dining with organic ingredients they grow their own food if you like it fresh and tasty then it s worth making the visit to the park not cheap but worth itok so i am probably the only negative review here so now you re all reading to begin i am a bay area foodie so the whole schtick appeals to me locally sourced carefully crafted to let the simple flavors of the foods themselves shine i get it it s like all we do around here this missed there was not one thing i ate that tasted good the host was superb energetic and more helpful than he needed to be the greenhouse is cool the space was beautiful and comfortable remarkable in the crappy winter weather but oh wait i liked the wine the waitress literally had her nose in the air she was not attentive or helpful in selecting wines or explaining the menu the food was flaccid and tasteless i know flaccid is not usually a descriptor for food but there you have it it perfectly describes the terrible meal that said everyone else loves it so i imagine you could have a good meal there but i eat out a lot and this was probably my worst meal ofthe restaurant was highly recommended and we decided to try it is far from the city center and its in the middle of a park a very beautiful place the experience was good but i think it s not a place i would come back in another time at amsterdamwe had tasting menu for   which was generally quite good veggies and salads really fresh and tasty grown on the property guinea fowl which was our main course was very good wonderful flavour and quite tender plenty of food for a tasting menu service generally excellent help with the wine was very high level and spot on with each course the highlight unquestionably however was the setting really gorgeous reno of the greenhouse in the park and when the tables were all dressed up for evening dinner service it was kind of magical i would recommend it as a special night out but be prepared to spend for the experiencethis is one of those restaurants that make you want to return to amsterdam over and over again well that the van gogh museum and the great ahem cafes built in a kwekerij or greenhouse the setting of windows light indoor and outdoor trees wide open gleaming floors and a huge vaulted glass ceiling the dining area itself is something to behold and a beautiful place for dinner the building being in a wooded lot across a bridge next to a canal the food changes every night you get three courses and they are always based on what is in the garden what is in season and how well they do and do not pair together while i could describe that our set three course menu with amuse bouche in between and a wine pairing if you chose it was incredible the one theme we found in the three times we have visited is the ingredients whether red or white meats sprouts turnips beets and carrots in winter or peas in warmer weather each ingredient has been ridiculously good like these are the best carrots i ever had or these are the best roasted beets i have ever had best pea soup i have ever had etc etc every dish course we have had has been very very good and impeccably prepared one bonus i have come to enjoy is not knowing what is for dinner just the anticipation that it is likely going to be more than f ing awesomewe went for lunch and it was just wonderful the location in a park without cars in the east part watergraafsmeer of amsterdam the staff very friendly young and welcoming the food and the price quality were good as was the extensive wine list we enjoyed a two course meal a vegan version for me with mostly local vegetables and home made sourdough bread   appetizers and a nice green tea to end with some vegan black chocolates all in all a very nice afternoon we ll be back for a full dinner experiencede kas is a high quality food and well designed restaurant located in amsterdam oost in the middle of a park food was tasty well decorated and made good use of fresh materials in spite of the pompous potential atmosphere is not heavy and service is friendly be ware that the high quality adjoins high pricesmost of the reviews of de kas in guide books and on the internet say that it is a wonderful restaurant i m afraid that we don t agree to our mind the food is pretty unadventurous and the service below what you should get in a restaurant of this calibre the menu is a secret you simply tell them what you don t like which is fine in theory but the food that we were presented didn t live up to the hype of this secret we got the feeling that they are resting on their laurels somewhat and perhaps the number of corporate customers eager to entertain here means that they don t need to try quite so hard we started with a soup of celery with leeks and a garlic foam this was the possibly the best thing we had though the garlic rather overwhelmed the other flavours next came two different things one for each of us a lobster tail unexceptional and venison unspectacular they did not ask us which we would prefer and they were not dishes you could share so this too was rather disappointing the main course was pork but was not very excitingly prepared the dessert was a sort of tiramisu made with beetroot and coffee it was tasty but not enough to raise the whole meal to the expected level yes the vegetables are all extremely fresh and the meat all locally sourced but the cooking of them didn t reach the heights you would expect of a top restaurant the conservatory dining room is a very lovely space but we found the staff not particularly helpful or attentive all in all i booked this restaurant expecting it to be the best meal we had during our   day trip to amsterdam sadly it was not what a pity a school report would say could do betterwent to eat here with friends on a recommendation and must say was not disappointed there was a story behind each course which the server explained simply a great experience with fantastic food and drinkthere aren t enough ways i can praise this restaurant i ve eaten everywhere from holes in the wall to michelin star restaurants and this was easily the best dining experience of my life and i can t imagine it will ever be topped we booked the chefs table months in advance not really knowing what was involved but excited to try it out we had several dietary restrictions that we notified them of which were easily accommodated we arrived at  pm and were escorted by the chef to our table i assumed we would have three or four courses with wine and be out of there in a couple of hours how wrong i was we had   courses of the most amazing food we had ever tasted which were paired with   wines that were mind blowing each chef in the kitchen would take turns preparing a special dish for us that wasn t being served to the rest of the diners in the restaurant they would deliver the dish themselves to our table and go into great detail about what they had prepared we loved watching them prepare the dishes and then hearing about what went into creating these masterpieces when i thought about dining in the kitchen i expected a loud atmosphere full of stressful staffers this kitchen was so impressively calm and organized in addition to the amazing attention we received from the chefs the sommelier was also excellent at pairing wines for us and giving us the utmost attention in addition to the amazing food and service we were also treated to a tour of the property including the greenhouse we loved learning the history of the restaurant and appreciate how de kas was doing farm to table way before this movement started becoming popular this dinner ended up being a five hour affair and we were in complete heaven the entire time we have decided next time we travel to europe we will fly into amsterdam just so we can have dinner there again before heading to our destination thank you so much to everyone at de kas for making this an experience i know we will never forget and will be talking about for years to comewe loved the surprise menu the atmosphere the open kitchen and the surrounding green house great food wine and a great vibeexcellent standard of food and service here the three of us enjoyed the set menu and wine pairings that were offered i was surprised how reasonable the prices were for food and ambiance of this calibre in other large cities i would expect to pay twice as much i would love to visit this place in the spring ashen we visited here in the late fall it was too dark outside to appreciate the beauty of the surrounding parkwe were recommended by a fellow traveler to this highly rated restaurant after a   euro taxi ride we had a just average meal for an exorbitant price the service was over the top the interior stark but not a michelin experiencethis restaurant is located in an enormous greenhouse that at one stage belonged to the council of amsterdam and that is located in park frankendael in the east of amsterdam all fresh ingredients are either from their own nursery or are sourced from local farmers growers the food is just stunning we have been coming here for lunch with family and friends from england for about   years and have loved the experience everey time lunch is   courses soooo delicious and the staff is well trained delightful speak fluent english but above all they are so knowlegdeable they must have had excellent training de kas i e the greenhouse is surrounded by fruit trees and vegetables plants which arrive at your table picked a few hours earlier we love itwe went here our last night in amsterdam and it was amazing and so well priced the equivalent meal would have been  x the price we had the   course plus the matching wine flight defintiely worth ita must visit restaurant away from the touristic scene a modern concept of what a traditional home made cuisine should be a very original presentation twisted with a delicious delicates mix of flavors where exotic vegetables are the main attraction of the whole meal journey i will definitely return on my next tripmost expensive restaurant we have visited in amsterdam and not the best by a long way doesn t really make the best of the lovely fresh herbs and vegetables nothing really brings out the intense flavours and some of the non vegetable ingredients are not the best lovely setting and well planned dining area but needs a spark doubt we ll come back we have our favourites and de kas has not changed our minds disappointedi reserved a table for two for dinner and requested for a quiet spot in the restaurant the staff replied my email personally which i think is a very nice touch to the whole experience i also requested to them to write a message on my date s dessert plate and it was nicely arranged and executed since it was our first visit our waiter told us the story of the restaurant and made sure we were comfortably seated the sparkling white wine produced in limburg that our waiter introduced me when i opted for champagne tasted heavenly the food was exquisite as expected from de kas s menu which differs everyday according to what kind of fresh produce they have for that day the ambience of the restaurant was nice the waiters were very attentive as well food was really good in a nutshell a must visit in amsterdam i ll be heading back for morethe food was delicious and the atmosphere wonderful there is no menu so choosing your meal is easy i recommend a reservation though we loved every part of our meal but since the menu changes daily there is no reason to explain each course i will say the caprese salad dessert was amazing and a roller coaster of flavor after eating you can walk through the greenhouse where a majority of your meal was once growingloved our lunch at de kas it is a bit of a walk from the centre but definitely worth it de kas which means greenhouse in dutch takes farm to table to a whole new level you sit in the middle of a large greenhouse and nearly all the vegetables you eat have been produced just a stone s throw away the meats are sourced from local farmers too and the food was wonderful light and full of flavor a walk through the herbal and vegetable garden later on just nicely completes the entire experiencei liked the food but did not fall in love the atmosphere and the idea counts a different experienceone dish was excellent another mediocre we do appreciate the freshness of it all service was extremely good perfect and friendly which is not the samethe setting decor and ambiance are wonderful friendly staff very attentive and speedy service everything is fresh and thought through you just have to let go and see what the chefs will cook that night on the evening our party attended i was a little disappointed by some dishes the soup and dessert were fantastic i am not a big fan of razor clams second course but it was fine of course the main dish pork was good but on the whole the food was not the most memorable part of the evening the setting wasde kas is a wonderful dining experience with great ambiance excellent food and pairings and the best service we have found since moving to amsterdam a must restaurant for anyone coming to amsterdamdefinitely one of the best meals i have eaten certainly this year the unique setting of an old renovated greenhouse slightly outside the centre is beautiful the service is perfect a no choice   course menu started with a richly flavoured celeriac soup followed by   starters using vegetables grown by the restaurant including a delicious dish with   types of beetroot and oxtail the main course was a fresh water fish perch with a salsa and again superlative vegetables including artichokes dessert was a white chocolate cake with a caramelised slice of pear and pear sorbet fresh and seasonal is the order of the day we opted for the wine flight which was very well chosen including a dessert wine and was very good value the restaurant was packed and reservations are recommended super bread too and they offered you an apple to take with you as you left memorablewonderful meal beautiful greenhouse and exceptional service this was our favorite meal in amsterdam and one of our best ever dining experiences the food is fresh simple flavorful and innovative book early they fill up quickly and for good reason five starsthis is a truly exceptional restaurant located a short journey beyond the city centre in an area not visited by many overseas tourists you have to make a bit of an effort to get here but if you do then you will be rewarded handsomely you eat in a gigantic greenhouse which has been fitted out with striking stylish furnishings and the atmosphere is unlike almost any other restaurant they offer only a set menu although you can alert them about allergies and similar things when you book and all the ingredients are locally grown and sourced freshness is a priority and our meal contained some of the most tasty and excellently cooked vegetables you can imagine meat and fish are treated with similar care craft and skill among the exceptional dishes were a celeriac endive and lovage soup slow roasted veal with pickled mushrooms and a trio of beetroots seared fillet of perch with potato rosti pak choi and pumpkin seeds and a cheese board of the highest quality service is impeccable this is a restaurant that really cares about food and expects its customers to do the same go on leave the city centre tourist traps behind and take yourself here for a gastronomic treatour best experience was the chef s table we were completely spoiled by the staff and the chef himself organic seasonal food some of it grown in the glasshouse next to the kitchen where we were also shown around all in all good quality and a very pleasant experiencei ve been wanting to come here since last winter the interior of this place is beautiful with light coming in from every direction this makes a great spot for foodie photographers everywhere first of all i enjoyed the olives and the mint tea before the start of our meal the olives were absolutely delicious and the mint was extremely fresh and fragrant we started off with a celeriac endive based soup which was very creamy then we had the beef brisket which wasn t my favourite but i still enjoyed it the beet salad with the chestnut mousse was well put together as well i expected to taste more of the chestnut but it paired well with the beets for the main course we had the baked cod with the pumpkin puree potatoes and some vegetables on the side the pumpkin puree was extremely tasty with the potatoes and the fish this was definitely my favourite out of all the other starters i had tried the restaurant is located in a nice and quiet area great for strolling around and taking in the crisp airset in a park in a huge greenhouse the atmosphere was great service excellent food creative and delicious everything tastes fresh and on the way in you pass the area where herbs and veggies are grown for the restaurant the menus are chosen for you but you can modify and switch go experiencenice food tasty but nothing really so fabulous especially for a degustation menu of   per person served with nothing special wines the service is perfect the staff is welcoming and dishes presentation is nice i think you mostly pay for the location rather than for what you are eating and   per person i think is too much also for this location box ticked ok but i don t think i will go againthis restaurant is amazing the interiour design is very nice the food is extraordinary and the service is great as well we have been there for lunch and it is highly recommended if you have the chance to get a table you should reserve as it is always sold outwonderful ambiance tasteful decor service is great food is okay but overpriced guests are mainly tourists it doesn t seem that the locals are dining there which tells you a lot still worth a visit just be prepared that you ll pay more than it is worth the location and the building renovated greenhouse are the main attraction so try to go when it is still light outside but don t expect too much of the foodwe sat at the chef s table in the kitchen the food was both in taste and preparation the wines were pared perfectly our server daniel was great we had plenty of opportunities to talk with the chef during many of the courses he was charming and anxious to share his knowledge sitting at the chef s table has many perks including a tour of the restaurant between courses this included a tour of the nursery where many of the greens we enjoyed are grown overall this is a top of the charts experience what a great treatwe had a wonderful dining experience here while pricey it was well worth the cost the dishes were excellently prepared and the wine pairings spot on all of this coupled with a beautiful setting and excellent service an evening to rememberme and my boyfriend   visited the restaurant for a special occasion after finding it on tripadvisor we were not disappointed it was very easy to find after getting a tram from the centre of amsterdam and took around   minutes the location is excellent set aside from the road but visible enough to make an impression we walked across the bridge and found the entrance we were greeted by a lovely lady who took our coats and showed us to our seats wow what an impressive room sat in a glass greenhouse immaculate tables and beautiful decoration we were given the wine list and chose the   course meal surprise option priced at   euros per person we took in the amazing surroundings whilst drinking wine and waited for our first course this was soup beautifully flavored with celery grown in the greenhouse next door served in a glass the taste was amazing we had another course that followed consisting of a vegetable mix and beef served with mushrooms beetroot and more veg for the main we had white perch potato rosti pumpkin jus and pine nuts amazing we were then offered the cheese board this was the only downfall as it was not offered in the   euros but sounded like it was this was   euros per person and we didn t enjoy it following this we had a white chocolate sponge dessert served with barbecued pear sorbet this was beautifully finished with words of celebration congratulations and happy birthday on my boyfriends plate each course was explained well before we ate which added a special touch another nice thing was that you never felt rushed time was given inbetween each meal after we had finished we were able to look around the greenhouses where all the local vegetables are produced and grown and offered an apple each on the way out overall excellent service a setting that is unique and one we will never forget perfect for our special occassion would recommend to anyone who is visiting amsterdam and looking for a beautiful meal thankyouwe are visiting amsterdam from the u k and chose to eat at de kas to celebrate my partners birthday we ve just returned very happy and very full service ambiance food and wine were all flawless the open kitchen is a nice touch my partner is a chef so he always likes to see what s going on i m gluten free and was able to have bread and cake during the meal which was nice as i can sometimes miss out on these little treats all in all a lovely lunch in a beautiful settingwe road our bikes to de kas from the jordaan on a hot summer day we arrived hot thirsty tired and a bit grumpy all our discomfort faded as soon as we were seated in the lovely glass restaurant and we begin our delicious meal reservations are hard to get so i recommend planning ahead and trying to go for dinnerif you enjoy eating and you enjoy having an amazing experience and you enjoy exceptional service you will not be disappointed coming to de kas just walking to the restaurant makes you smile located in a greenhouse that actually grows much of the food you will eat it is an experience that cannot be missed the restaurant quickly vaulted into one of the best i have ever eaten in wait staff is very alert to allergies and customer tastes and as the courses come out one after the next you feel yourself getting more and more excited can this get any better how do they make these dishesbeautiful room very good and aesthetical food almost all vegetarian good vine and very polite servants you could be sitting there all dayit was my birthday and i was instantly congratulated when we walked in i really enjoyed the scenery and the set up even though it is one big space the entourage was cosy and enjoyable dishes were define and delicious only the staff was too stiff and impersonal nowadays staff can throughly be more caring and interested in my opinion that s what set the   stars from the   i think not sure why just a feeling that they are working with outsourced staff during lunch as the staff which helped us was not that involved nevertheless the food was greatwhen we knew we were going to amsterdam the first thing i did was to get a reservation at de kas that says something it is located well out of the main section of amsterdam but it is worth the taxi trip there for the meal the restaurant is on the edge of a park in a converted greenhouse on one side of the greenhouse and out doors are some of their gardens which supply the meal the meal is set   small starters we had a potato soup with fennel pumpkin slice with pumpkin hummus and mushrooms on puff pastry a main course veal done   ways and dessert beetroot with pistachios and chocolate bits yogurt and sea salt caramel ice cream and an optional cheese course it was all delicious with a depth of flavor beautifully present and an unusual combination of ingredients when did you last have beetroot in a dessert also the tables are just far enough apart that you don t think you are eating with your neighbor and the noise level is controlled we went back looking forward to the meal and were not disappointed we will go back againwe ve dined at restaurant de kas a number of time and always found the experience exceptional our most recent visit on the last night of a lengthy eurpean vacation was just that the farm to table approach ensures all the food served is fresh and healthy and it was prepared and served with great care the menu is fixed except they usually offer a alternative to meat for the main course the wine pairings a done nicely and reasonably priced de kas is different from all the other restaurants in amsterdam and the experience is worth the cost great ambience and fun nightwrote a review in may but for some reason it did not post so will try again unique restaurant set in the middle of a beautiful park there are windows everywhere form the walls to the ceilings which made you feel like you were sitting right in the park there is also a greenhouse connected where most of the food is grown we decided to try the tasting menu and we were not disappointed everything was super fresh and flavored perfectly wine selection was also good great dining experience with great foodthe restaurant is set in a quiet park away from the center of amsterdam it consists of a few giant greenhouses the restaurant is set in one of these and the others are used for growing the vegetables and fruits served at dinner most of the other ingredients are locally sourced there is only one menu each evening consisting of     appetizers an entree and dessert a wine pairing which i highly would recommend is also offered at an additional cost the food was prepared and presented in such a way that the flavors were crisp and distinct without attempting to be too hip for the sake of trendiness each dish and paired wine was offered by a different wait staff member who described it in a concise yet informative presentation de kas ensures that the fresh ingredients perfectly prepared are the stars of the dinner the paired wines were perfect accompaniments to each course the high roof of the greenhouse helps maintain a very low noise level allowing for an intimate setting definitely make reservations in advance and prepare yourself for a memorable dining experienceyou have to put your diet in the hands of the restaurent set menu but every course was wonderful service was great setting really nice recommendedhad booked for a birthday lunch with a friend the setting amidst the greenhouse growing the restaurant s fruits vegetables and herbs was an amazing experience the lunch menu was beautifully prepared and flavored the dutch wines surprisingly paired with the courses a lovely place to enjoy good food take in the serenity of the surroundings and indulgethis is an amazing restaurant the place raises its own friut and vegetable the taste is exceptional each evening there is just one menue for everybody with vegetable of the season and from own production it is one of the best reataurants i had the pleasure to experience as the quality is known at locals it is highly recommended to make a reservation in advance this place is fully booked eache eveningthe experience from beginning to end was fantastic as a foodie each morsel was relished and each course better than the next the only thing better than this was the reception from the entire team our server for lunch was daiga who did a tremendous job of looking after our every need this was well worth every euro spent on the lunch and frankly is a must stop place for either lunch or dinner but be cautioned book ahead to avoid disappointmentwe had an excellent meal here the restaurant is set in a park in the south of amsterdam about   tram stops from the centre it is in a rebuilt greenhouse and uses a lot of fruit and vegetables grown there but it s not a vegetarian restaurant no a la carte menu there are   courses or   if you want cheese and you have no idea what is coming though you are asked if there is anything you cannot eat we had some delightful courses and we also had their wine flight e    of   different wines to accompany the food we thought it was all terrific value so why only   stars it is because it took an absolute age to get the first course   mins after ordering after that no problem but we very nearly left because we were fed up with waiting do try this restaurant which is also very popular with locals it was absolutely full on a wet thursday in septembera beautiful and exceptionally well run restaurant the park location is gorgeous and if you have time to kill as we did you can explore the veg patch and greenhouses and see where your food is coming from the waitresses were all lovely and clearly very proud of the food everything was explained carefully and helpful recommendations made the food was outstanding as was the dutch sparkling winethis beautiful restaurant located in the middle of a quiet city park was a fantastic experience the freshest of food most of it grown in the restaurant s own gardens is simply delicious although the menu is limited des kas s creative use of varied ingredients together with its fun atmosphere create a wonderful ambience it was a truly amazing dining experiencethis restaurant is something different it is situated in the middle of the park is surrounded by all green from inside you can see all around because all is made by glass even de sealing the food is amazing the ingredients all freshthe four of us booked at de kas to celebrate a couple of birthdays during our weekend in amsterdam we liked the sustainable angle and the freshness advertised online the chef s table gave us front row seats to the rythmn of the kitchen serene and inventive the personal implication of each chef presenting their contribution was delightful each dish very generous and creative and each chef unique each of us had a favorite chef dish the enthusiasm of the team was obvious the owner is doing something very right the creative combinations to be found in our plate wwere exciting and most often a success we finished the evening in the large dining room magical at night the pear sauce matched with the dutch cheeses was amazing highly recommend this restaurantwe stayed in the jordaan district of amsterdam and walked from our houseboat to de kas for lunch it was a pretty aggressive walk but very doable it was definitely a great way to see the city this stunning greenhouse restaurant is located in the frankendael park which feels like you re in the dutch countryside their mantra is food tastes best when it s fresh and it s fresh alright all the herbs and greens that touch your plate are grown on site in their greenhouse and neighboring gardens it would be hard to recommend a dish as the menu changes daily to take advantage of the seasonal spread service ambiance and food was spectacular a bit pricy but worth the experienceevery single dish was melt in your mouth delicious even the picky eaters at my table thought so beautiful presentations excellent staff a must if you are visiting amsterdamreally enjoyed my visit to de kas this week as plenty of other reviewers have mentioned this restaurant is situated in a glasshouse surrounded by gardens in one of amsterdam s parks i was attending a business dinner with over   colleagues so we had the restaurant to ourselves the whole environment is very light and airy so even with this number of people the tables were not cramped with plenty of room to spread out our dinner commenced with a glass of pumpkin soup of roasted red kuri squash and braised cavolo nero absolutely superb this was followed by a little gem lettuce which had been flashed on a hot plate and served with goat s cheese anchovies and minced pork the fish course was good sized portion of smoked salmon with some lovage a fennel seed brioche and served with a yoghurt dressing main course was roasted guinea fowl served with some mashed potato kohlrabi and a spiced jus to end the meal we were served a slice of chocolate pecan tart with raspberries pistachio nuts and some vanilla ice cream the accompanying dutch wines had been chosen by the restaurant to compliment each course starting with a sparkling riesling and ending with some form of genever liquer all again were excellent particularily the reislingas a menu for   people i could not fault the choice of dishes or the quality of any the food all of the vegetables are grown on site or on the restaurant s nearby farm and they really pride themselves on serving the best and freshest ingredients available as this was a company function i don t know the cost of the menu but for normal dining the three course dinner menu is priced at     which consists of three small starters     followed by a main course     and a dessert at    this was a really great dining experience and i will most definitely be back just a pity it s a bit of a journey from my home in rijswijkexpansive restaurant worth every eu wonderful experience wonderful food wonderful team recommendgreat staff and the food is even better the restaurant is in an old greenhouse and the food is sourced from the greenhouse or a farm they have nearby all the courses were great and the pork cheek was exceptional a perfectly balanced mealvery courteous and accommodating staff something pretty bohemian chic about this place in a green house and all that they offer pre fixe menu s only which we ordered the appetizers were split into a soup and three small plates the soup was completely amazing the   small plates were good we got a fish as our main course which was very fresh clean seemingly healthy but not the wow factor on taste cant put it down as it was good but not great wait staff is very friendly and attentive decent wine list i would go againwe booked de kas a couple of weeks before our trip via their easy online reservation system we were so glad that we did this was the best meal we had in our trip through belgium and the netherlands the menu is fixed and the they use products from the garden to make amazing dishes we especially liked the potato soup with a smoky bacon flavor the rabbit was also very good the dessert was the best part to an already exquisite meal it had so many different flavors that blended together perfectly this restaurant is an experience a unique destination of culinary science the atmosphere is clean and simple noise level at capacity was surprisingly muffled the pacing of dinner was perfect and we never felt rushed wait staff checked on us frequently and refilled water without asking we would certainly dine here again in the futurethis restaurant is poor on  st impressions it looks great and the  st course of soup was excellent after that the food went downhill massively as did the ambience in the restaurant as it started to thin out very pricey for what it is much better local restaurants in the heart of amsterdam stick to more authentic places to eat and not one that s trying to be something unique a waste of timeyes yes yes beautiful location in a greenhouse with an adjoining kitchen garden most of the items prepared for dinner were from the gardens and it was elegantly and deliciously prepared the vibe was comfortable yet the food was fantastic if you are a picky eater realize that it is a fixed menu and you ll eat what they bring you my wife if lactose gluten free which they accommodated exceptionally well the wine pairing was one of the best i have experienced and i love doing wine pairings when offered the sommelier clearly made some excellent choices and we enjoyed wines from around europe hats off to the sommelier fabieene i believe her name was next time we return to amsterdam we will return to this restaurant for surewalking in through the glasshouse past vines laden with enormous heirloom tomatoes we got an inkling of the locally sources high quality food that would feature throughout the meal the horsd oeuvres included marinated rainbow beetroot chunks again most probably from the veggie patch then seated in the spacious garden room we were briefly overwhelmed that we might need to choose between the three listed starters but then relieved and delighted that instead they featured sequentially there was an emphasis on a cornucopia of fresh vegetables in interesting combinations alongside norwegian salmon ok not from the nearby lake then later guinea fowl all in combinations that presented flvours so well the waitresses were so refreshingly helpful and knowledgeable about wine including dutch white wines and one person s request to see the huge green egg cooking device mentioned on the menu he was promptly given a tour of the kitchen to see that impressive sight would thoroughly recommend this restaurant serving refreshingly fresh cuisine in a beautiful settingthis restaurant is located in a greenhouse and has his own kitchen garden stylish interior impeccable service ingredients of good quality extensive choice of wines attractive dishes and small portionsde kas is really a good experience everything was good some beans and olives at beginning     entrees the meal duck and vegetables and a dessert i didn t really liked peaches with liquored noodles basilic ice cream it was good but not my taste at the end you can take an apple which are really good servers are really nice alsoyou don t get to dine in a greenhouse located inside an amsterdam park every day so we were very keen to follow this recommendation the walk to the location is already nice and the view from outside at night is stunning we were received friendly taken to our table all nice and neat without being overloaded service was very friendly the menu is not too exhaustive which we like and so we ordered starters and main i chose pulpo and duck as well as the small accompanying wine package for   which i think is a fair price the dishes came beautifully arranged and were very well done the very nice waiter then gave us a tour through the rest of the location we took a closer look at the kitchen the room for private function and the greenhouse they are using to bring up the stuff they serve us obviously they use other locations to grow veggies etc as the space there is limited we loved the concept and the overall experience it is a beautiful and remarkable placethe chef s table at de kas is a treat you will never forget the food was amazing the staff friendly personable the chef took time from his busy evening to speak with us throughout the evening the spotless kitchen was filled with an energy from the kitchen staff that i ve never experienced before add in perfect pairing from their wonderful sommelier and you have a fantastic foodie experience do yourself a favor if you can get a reservation at this chef s table grab itthe restautant is located in a garden and you eat in a green house the ambience and setting is beautiful and truly memorable the idea with the food to be primarily vegetables and the proteins being secondary is timely and a great idea unfortunately both the wine selections as well as the dishes are lacking the necessary pop to make it a memorable experiencefabulous restaurant with wonderful food and wine took my boyfriend for his  th and the staff looked after us very wellde kas is situated in a rather large greenhouse and they grow most of the food they serve i love the concept and the execution was almost perfect the interior is minimally decorated which i like the food was very good but the portions were small and it was quite pricey for a lunch time meal the service was excellent and is probably the best thing about de kas the place had quite a formal feel so don t go expecting a buzzing atmosphere overall i enjoyed my experience and i probably would go again but it wouldn t be a place i would visit every week if i lived in amsterdamif you are looking for a beautiful place for your meal de kas a former greenhouse located in a park is your place it s really idyllic food however is not memorable and to be honest the menu looked a little pretentious to me i had a   course lunch meal food looked beautiful but tasted ok i didn t even bother to have desert anyway i think it was worth it specially because after lunch i had a long walk in the lovely parkwe spend a fabulous night at the chef s table it was one of the best meals i have had the chefs were also very friendly and came up to chat with uswhile in amsterdam we had a delicious dinner at the beautiful de kas restaurant in a greenhouse setting in a park they have their own garden and use the freshest local ingredients we chose this establishment on the recommendation of our concierge and were very pleased with the entire experience we did not realize that the menu which varies weekly consists of a surprise prix fixe four course dinner and included vegetarian fish and meat dishes the setting is lovely and the service excellent we are rather picky about our food choices tending to eat healthy and everything was prepared perfectly to our specifications there were many tourists there far more than locals i would say and it is a fairly expensive restaurant compared with some others but worth it we wanted atmosphere as well as great food and we were extremely satisfied would definitely return for another surprise meal when back in amsterdami have been to de kas for dinner with friends and family and yesterday for a wedding on both occasions they exceeded expectations it s already worth going there just for the location a greenhouse in which they grow their own food anything you order is a delicious out of the ordinary combination of high quality ingredients service is friendly and professional i simply have nothing bad to say about de kas just go therei went solo after a meeting it is a very unique experience as there is no menu and you mostly eat what they produce at their backyard the waiters asked if i was allergic to any ingredient and then brought the products of the day you should definitely try itwe had our first night of our honeymoon here location is stunning table service was attentive but not overbearing waiter explained the wine pairings and the food menu was a surprise as they change the menu every day but we loved all of it and it meant we had food we wouldn t normally have ordered the quality was reflected in the price so worth it though my wife said it s the best food she s ever hadthis place came recommended from our host so we booked   weeks in advance the farm to table method is a lovely idea and that you can wander through the greenhouse and gardens also the meat and fish are ethically sourced a lovely concept and we will definitely be back when we are in amsterdam in decemberwe had been looking forward to this restaurant as friends had raved about it in advance it certainly lived up to our expectations the gorgeous glass conservatory ambiance attractive and attentive staff and intriguing unique menu were each extraordinary we opted to be surprised for our four course meal enhanced by the wine flight while it s not inexpensive we thought it a great value as a similar meal in the united states could run well over our tab we spent about   euros per person including cocktails and wine we will pay it forward by recommending this restaurant to anyone who is visiting amsterdamwe paid   euro for a fix menu for two the waiter was very professional but not kind and not very attentive we basically filled up by the brad that was excellent because there was nothing to eat the dishes was served nicely but the taste was only ok for the amount that we paid it was a disappointment a big onea relaxed restaurant with amazing food it won t be to everyone s taste as it was a set menu although you could state whether you required veggie fish or meat dishes the menu changes weekly i loved the ethos this restaurant is simply about good fresh food much of it grown on site the staff are knowledgeable and interested in what you thought of each course i am vegetarian and loved it my husband who is a meat eater felt the same way he had pigeon for his main salmon for his starter we would definitely returnfirst visit here with high expectations all was first class the setting the seating the welcome the service the food the wine all without being over the top stylish and understated fine dining would return every week if i couldit s a little while since we were last at de kas but it s one of the very few restaurants to which we always try and return the simple concept of a menu based in what s available and seasonal in their kitchen gardens means a great experience every time in a unique setting the tram will get you close and then after a short walk your experience begins at the door of the glasshouse simple furnishings a cast concrete bar and an always buzzing atmosphere characterise this restaurant the service is excellent and unobtrusive and the food is fresh flavoursome delightful to the eye and simply wonderful on the taste buds de kas is a lesson in following a great idea through to every detail and making every dining experience very specialthis is a beautiful restaurant located in a greenhouse with a nearby garden and fields where they grow all produce all food is organic the food is delicious the wine selection varied and very good and the service excellent without being intrusive they have only one seating though not at a particular time so you never feel rushed it is not inexpensive but definitely worth the costwe booked this restaurant as it was highly rated in all listings for top restaurant in the city the setting is amazing a greenhouse set in a park upon arrival you our shown there herb garden very impressive all organic and going to be cooked in the food there there is a set menu no choices first course soup mini portion   spoonfuls and totally lacking in flavour and tasteless second course fish local north sea bland and no flavoursthird course lamb with vegetables minuscule portion finally desert for such a highly rated place the dress code was very mixed up service was fair but not great this was a birthday celebration for us and a special occasion would never ever recommend this restaurant to any of my friends or acquaintancessuperb experience great concept the taste of the vegetables was excellent fantastic service certainly a place to revisit next time i m in amsterdami sent an email to de kas restaurant a few months before our visit to amsterdam for our honeymoon the communication and replies to my emails were swift and all my special requirements were handled in a very professional manner now visiting the restaurant itself was something else the walk to it was an experience on itself then then greeted us upon our arrival and checked our reservation a waiter called victor took us to our table and he was mainly with us throughout the dinner victor was friendly and knowledgeable and made our experience so much better than you victor attached are picture we took there i could not recommend it morethe concept of this restaurant is something i like the food was very fresh and well prepared service was friendly and efficient the restaurant itself feels light and airy i only give it four stars as a i was on a fixed menu as visited with group and a couple of courses were just not things i enjoy however i can appreciate they were very well made and everyone else certainly enjoyed themlovely place where you relax and enjoy waitors are super friendly and proffesionals food is very good and comes from a good enviorement love to come backde kas is a really exciting restaurant located in a set of old greenhouses de kas grow their own herbs and vegatebles some in the greenhouse where the restaurant is located some on their farmland the dishes consists of lots of vegetables fruit herbs and flowers put together in a way that brings the flavours and taste up to another level the wines matched the food perfectly making this a fantastic meal in spectacular surroundingsit may not be as flashy or glitzy as the other michelin restaurants in amsterdam but the understated design and elegance of the restaurant mirrors that of the food it serves all the ingredients they use come from the greenhouse on premise where the restaurant gets its name from service is great and personal they will even show you the greenhouse where the chef picks his herbs and ingredients each delicious course is meticulously designed and crafted to leave a fragrant after taste in your mouth it s hard to explain but leaving the greenhouse that is de kas i felt strangely fresh and invigorated and healthygreat atmosphere excellent service delicious menu if you re a foodie and looking for a dining experience without a touristy feel this is a real treatde kas was suggested to me by a local amsterdam man who knew my appreciation of farm to fork so i made the reservation about a month in advance for the chef s table you have to reserve for  pm     courses takes an entire evening clearly my     body could not make the hop up to the viking sized bench table in the kitchen after some chuckling and my request for a milk crate they brought me a stool so i could hop up after introductions from the host and chef niels the courses and pairings began de kas has a set menu for the week using what was abundant in their farm sourcing proteins from local farmers watching this professional staff in this pristine kitchen was like watching an opera and ballet at the same time tickets come in courses are called and plates are created for us each time we were served a course the chef that created it would introduce himself and then explain the course i loved that the chef was given the ingredient and then allowed to create the course himself the courses were brilliant containing a wide variety vegetables sauces cheeses protiens the pairings were inspired and reflected thought and a knowledge of both the food and the grapes when we were down to the dessert course that featured cherries cherries and more cherries were first given a complete tour of the house and green house we enjoyed dessert in the main dining room as the staff began kitchen clean up chef bas chef neils the little boy lucky charms and our lovely host who s name i found impossible to pronounce thank you so much for one of the best evenings of my life as a chef i found dekas truly inspirationalthe meal was delicious the restaurant is inside a nursery and there are front and back gardens they grow produce there the chef even showed us around his green house it is a fixed menu so be prepared the cooking is very fresh and inventive each course is a work of art we especially liked the strawberry cheesecake we enjoyed his selection of wine the price is very reasonable it is a unique restaurantwe had a lovely meal here really appreciate the emphasis on local and sustainable food sources felt that the meal was a little underwhelming given all the to do about the provenance of the food also be forewarned that it is a fixed menu that changes every day so for those people without a spirit of adventure may not be good choice service was outstanding very attentive and helpful they prepared a great alternate menu for our three year old daughter who loved the food and the setting is so serene and trendy would definitely recommends this but we had better meal experiences in amsterdamnwhat a great meal and experience some of the dinner was grow on the restaurant grounds food was just perfectdelicious organic home grown veggies and herbs in a beautiful garden park setting where bees hum and butterflies flitter around whilst you eat a four course meal arranged by the chef daily according to the fresh produce on hand a real treat and the best so far in amsterdam that i have been too open lunch and dinner book way in advancewe had friends recommend this restaurant before we left on our trip to europe interesting to be eating in what was apparently once a working greenhouse neither of us was prepared for a fixed menu however and i would have preferred to have some choice of entrees that said the food was well prepared and inventive service was ok but was a bit slow surprising in view of the fact we were there on a rainy day and the place was not all that busy if you like fresh home grown vegetables and don t mind having to eat what has been selected for the day i do suggest you give it a try when we next visit amsterdam a return visit will be in order but with a much different set of expectations ps the wine selection was quite nicei booked this on a whim on our last day in amsterdam me and my partner were very pleased with my choice ingredients and food were very fresh location in a glasshouse made for great atmosphere on a summer afternoon easily accessible from central amsterdam by tram only a three minute walk away was very memorable and will definitely visit while next in amsterdamfrom the moment we stepped onto the property we felt the magic of this place the setting is so charming the wait staff so welcoming and the food is sublime it is a set menu based on what is grown in their gardens that day so the suprises keep coming do yourself a favor and let them pair your wines don t miss this jemtwo well traveled friends each recommended this spot and we are so glad made an on line reservation in advance but was already limited to the one night they still had available during our trip so book ahead the restaurant is inside a nursery all glass and beautifully designed in frontt and back are gardens where they grow produce and flowers in addition to a larger off site farm the menu is unpublished and changes each week my husband is vegan and all accommodations were made each of three courses was exceptionally delicious and so beautifully displayed truly works of art you can taste the fresh vegetables and flowers every aspect is considered highly recommend and try to go during day light if possible for full effect we are from nyc so the price was profoundly reasonable for this level of quality and experiencewe reserved the chef s table for one evening during our trip to amsterdam i can honestly say it was one of the best meals of my life we were seated at a lovely table in the kitchen and could see the chefs as they worked the chefs were gracious and welcoming each one introduced the dish they had personally prepared and told us about the ingredients and their local sources the sommelier was friendly and knowledgeable and generous with the pours for the wine accompaniments we had a post dinner tour of the restaurant s greenhouses and gardens where most of the fruit and vegetable ingredients come from before returning for dessert we were probably there for about   hours altogether never rushed as we enjoyed our long multi course meal the food was fresh beautifully prepared and delicious the surroundings are gorgeous it s really something to be dining in large converted glass greenhouses in the middle of a beautiful park i still can t believe what a good price we paid for a truly premium meal and experience we were so impressed with the obvious pride everyone had in their restaurant we would definitely go backa very unique restaurant located in the middle of a park the structure is a glasshouse where they grow and serve their vegetables the service is top notch as well as the ambiance set menu which understandingly revolves around greens very good courses but not memorable worth the visit and the price for the surroundings staff and uniqueness don t miss the stork s nest across from the entrancebeautiful place and great concept the menu changes according to what the restaurant has grown so you don t know what you re going to get it was nice to be surprise and all dishes were amazing lots of new tastes and excellent qualitywe had lunch here on a hot day and it was amazing the menu was a set menu centred on fish which one of our party can t eat they added some vegetarian dishes to our meal with ease and they were some of the stars of the show this is a fabulous place to experience the freshest home grown vegetables cooked with michelin finesse to produce dishes that demand oohs and aahs we were on the terrace but the interiors looked super stylish will definitely return for dinnermy husband and i had dinner there with a friend it was really good the service was impeccable the food was very fresh mostly seafood and veggies from their garden the wine pairing was also very good we were surprised to find the sparkling white wine from the netherlands really good and also the austrian red wine you have to book a week in advance though as the place is quite famouswe cycled to this very elegant greenhouse restaurant outside the city center of amsterdam it was the one time i felt overtly under dressed in amsterdam smart casual might be the best way to describe the environment the restaurant is in an underwhelming park but its decor and food is well worth the trip out of town the dining space is light airy and modern it is simple and bright the wait staff is friendly the food ample and innovative i imagine it is even prettier by night than by day but it was a very pleasant place to lunch and when compared to manhattan prices also a good value i would not bring children here unless they are quiet well mannered and have a reasonably sophisticated palette it isn t the right environment for a weed smoking hemp hugging teenager in a deadhead t shirt either the staff is polite and casually friendly but i think they take the food and the service seriously without being ostentatious about it diners are invited to explore the greenhouse but must be mindful not to let the bees out or in i forget we enjoyed two glasses of wine but had been given enough food that cycling back to the city center was not a problemthe restaurant is located right inside a park in amsterdam great atmosphere all around the design is excellent i loved the greenhouse style and the glass roof walls the service was excellent we were very impressed by a young man with blonde hair who took care of our wine order he was very friendly and recommended different areas that we could visit the food was     it was definitely tasty and fresh but the portions were quite small for their price it is definitely recommended for a visitmy husband and i are foodies and we have to say one of the best meals we ve had in amsterdam enjoyed lunch on their beautiful patio overlooking the gardens all fresh ingredients with gorgeous plating excellent wine as well the only downside was my husband was craving a beer on a warm summer day and they don t serve beerwe enjoyed our experience at de kas the restaurant is outside the center of amsterdam so it was a     minute taxi ride each way the open dining room with light shining through the late evening at     pm created a really nice atmosphere and surroundings the menu is fixed price and you are surprised with each course from beginning to end we enjoyed each course and they were very accommodating with our gluten free diet restrictions as we also let them know in advance the wine was our only extra cost the service was very good as well as they described each course as they were served we really liked the farm to table concept as well as the location being outside the tourist areas you have an opportunity to walk the greenhouse so you may want leave some time to do that as well the restaurant will call for a taxi for you and it will arrive within   minutesvery nice vegetables and ingredients quite simple the combinations were not always that good though we were   peoplebusiness trip of around   people and we were seated together in a large room next to the greenhouse we could see lots of ingredients being grown for the kitchen the food was described as it came out as lots of ingredients were unknown or untried like flowers and cucumber ice cream it was a good experience and the food was very good please visit this lovely park and enjoy the foodde kas was unusually open on the sunday of our weekend trip to amsterdam as it was mothers day there lucky for us as it was a very interesting and enjoyable meal lovely to walk around the garden and greenhouse to view the home grown produce and to discuss their philosophy with the staff had a lovely local sparkling wine as an aperitifbeen there several years ago a couple of times the best that changed were the storks that are now situated on a different chimney and can be viewed from the terrace for a three course menu the first course is split in three aperitif  euro s wine arrangement water coffee about   euro s for two iis expensive especially when considering that all guests eat the same this means very easy cooking and economy in acquiring ingredients so one expects really something special although the food is ok it is not special except the fact that all most ingredients come from the beemster we felt the compositions were also to complex in terms of taste which made it a bit artificial also the personnel behaved friendly but also a bit artificial at all tables exactly the same explanations were given well rehearsed so the place is not bad but not authentic anymore except the storks they have unfortunately become an apparently highly appreciated tourist attraction given the fact the are booked almost any nightde kas was recommended by friends and it appeared on several lists of special restaurants in amsterdam we were not disappointed from the moment we arrived and had cocktails on the patio to the final touches everything was thoughtful delicious and well presented the location should not be a deterrent it was totally worth the trip to dine here gowe heard so much about it unfortunately not a good night service was sloppy food was just ok but lacking seasoning defenetely not what we expected unfortunately not a good night over priced sorrywe arrived at   and never left until after   the service was excellent and we were made to feel as if we were the only ones being served it was a very personable staff the wine pairings were delicious amsterdam s own bessen jenever red dessert wine paired with the beet chocolate cake and mint yogurt ice cream was perfect on a hot night being surprised by each course added to the fun i can t say enough about this unique dining experiencewe had read about this restaurant at home in italy and were very keen to try it for lunch yesterday when we had finally found it you can t see it from the road as it is in a park over a little bridge the buildlings gardens and decor of the restaurant do not dissappoint inside it is very stylish and bright with an open kitchen that you can look into a beautiful bar area and excellent service the very friendly waitress explained that there is no a la carte and you cannot choose very easy for the chef the lunch menu costs   pp for two courses which seemed quite expensive to me the starters split in three consisted of a small cup of cold cucumber soup a peace of toast with vegetables goats cheese and a very small salad with grilled courgettes and one small mediteranian prawn or gamba plus a square piece of watermelon that seemed really out of place like a fish out of water then the fish a pan fried skate thin strips of tasteless white strings neither of us wanted to eat it so we left it but luckily the polenta and beans on the side were very tasty and the italian white wine we had ordered was crisp i did ask why they would serve skate as it is not a usual dutch fish and being a scuba diver i prefer to see all types of rays swim in the see not fried on my plate they offered us the coffee on the house they were very nice but for a place that is trying to promote all their own home grown produce they should try stay closer to home with their fish meat choices and although all the dishes where presented very nicely i still think for what they were how they tasted they lacked quality and were overpriced to top it all off we came back tot our car parked along the road over the bridge in a paid car parking area the rear window had been smashed in and a nice jacket the only thing left in the car with any value had been stolen so if we the   we have to pay for a new window to the   we spent at de kas it was a very expensive lunch indeed and one not to be repeated so please if you do visit de kas don t park along the kamerlingh onneslaan but find a covered carpark insteadi was there with my husband and daughter in june   for my birthday we had lunch in a very cold day for june the place amazing food wobderful people polite and friendly price right don t miss the placemy husband and i went for lunch and it was such a great dining experience lovely service atmosphere design and the food was incredible the freshness and organic produce used in each dish the presentation and the flavours were so good you definitely need to make reservations as they fill up quickly it is a set menu each day using their locally grown produce and fresh ingredients my husband and i had this restaurant on our list for a while and we re so glad we were able to finally go can t wait to returnthis time we went to de kas for lunch excellent food and service yet again fresh healthy food in a great buildingmy friend and i had a wonderful meal at de kas to celebrate my recent birthday beautiful setting fresh and delicious food i highly recommend this restaurant especially for a special occasionnice pleasant restaurant good food good service we had dinner which is limited to a five course one menu cooked based on the days harvest we had a selection between fish and duck quite a busy restaurant so best is to get a reservation before you gothis is a wonderful place to spend an evening the food is all grown in the surrounding greenhouses or else its locally sourced the offerings are inventive and presented beautifully in this restaurant you will be served what is on the menu for the day you won t be able to pick your entree however they do have vegetarian options and will adapt their menu to any food allergies or dislikes this is not a place for a meat and potatoes person they will be disappointed they will however renew your love of fresh producewe splashed out for the kitchen table and compared to some uk michelin star restaurants for their tasting menu the price is reasonable from memory we paid around   euros each including the wine tasting the restaurant booking online was simple and easy even though we don t speak dutch the welcome was fantastic and the meal was very memorable sitting in the greenhouse next to plants that have been picked to provide your dinner is a must for any food lover or gardener we had a very enjoyable time here with a superb information from the sommelier and the chefs we were made to feel very welcome and each dish was presented beautifully and the flavours were fresh and everything was perfectly cooked highly recommend going in a season that suits the food you likewhat a place to celebrate a big day we were six people having a superb evening with   curse dinner with short traveled food wine packet and very friendly staff topp food wonderful location and for a reasonable price we ll be backhighly recommend this restaurant best for people who love fresh veggies my husband the steak and potato eater was not as pleased with it the location is the brooklyn of amsterdam not a place to shop or go out but a place where families move for me green space but are still close to the city the restaurant is in a green house where they grow the produce pretty cool the peas are incrediblemy husband and i dined at de kas in july   we biked from our hotel to the beautiful greenhouse right outside the city center the ambience of the restaurant simply cannot be beat just gorgeous and full of natural light the food was just as lovely beautifully prepared and locally sourced a wonderful dinner in a wonderful settingtheir card says harvest from the tunnel greenhouse and that about sums it up you are dining in a greenhouse as you enter you will see gorgeous plants heavy with the bounty you are about to indulge in i saw that there were peas on the vine and then there later appeared a cup of soup in front of me made of peas and other things from their produce and it was delicious we have eaten here on previous trips and it is a destination for us the setting is gorgeous it was raining when we were there and it just added to the ambience as the drops hit the glass one of our party was a vegetarian and they accommodated her beautifully while we enjoyed roast chicken my husband had eaten here the night before with biz associates and he said the offerings were equally delicious and completely different the only issue i had was that we came with our   year old and they like most high end restaurants tend to want to seat people with kids at a crappy table but my husband pointed out that he had made a reservation way in advance and had dined there the night before and requested a table in a certain area and the hostess although not super sweet about it did accommodate us i won t let that drop my review to   stars but come on people stop trying to marginalize people with kidsone of our better meals in amsterdam the location is lovely a working greenhouse in a park about   minutes from where we were staying vodelspark food was simply and nicely cooked making use of fresh ingredients some sourced from their greenhouse but mainly working with local suppliers had dinner with their wine pairings which was enthusiastically served only a set menu though so those with allergies or preferences should call the restaurant first nicetaking a friend known for being a fussy eater the evening could have turned in to a disaster as i did not know when booking that de kas served a set menu i can eat anything so was rather pleased when every dish my friend was presented with was relished and i let out a joyful phew each time we were were presented with   starters   main course followed by a dessertthe spanish olive oil and soda bread tasted of green grass and set the tone of quality to comethe flavours of the delicate vegetables accompanying each dish from long cooked veal cheak to barbequed chicken was a real delightdrinking a lovely dutch sparking while the evening sun shone through the greenhouse setting this topped off a lovely trip combining gourmet food with  th century canal house and rijkmuseum arta glamorous place with equally well groomed diners the whole restaurant appeared to share in the collective satisfacion of excellent food and despite the gasp at the lack of choice my friend was as happy as i was and we would recommend without hesitationthis restaurant was a nice meeting with excellent food we really enjoyed the meal we was on a bussinesstrip to amsterdam and the company we visited took us here it was the best restaurant we visited for this time in amsterdami highly recommend this restaurant nice atmosphere excellent food and service and a strong concept they truly live up totwo of my children youngish adults said we just had to go to de kas as it is one of the most exciting restaurants they had ever visited so it was with a great deal of anticipation that my wife and along with three friends went there for lunch in early may the setting is great and we were blessed with a perfect spring day to enjoy the building and its surroundings you take pot luck with the food because it is a set menu of what is the best available on the day and again our luck seemed to be in because virtually everything that arrived was excellent the service was very good as was the entire experience i cannot say this is the best restaurant i have ever been to but it is certainly in the top fivei was on a short trip in amsterdam and had only possibility to have lunch here as on that day it was not possible to reserve a table for dinner overall my experience was good the presentation of food the place it self and the service was nice the only comment i had about food was very much salt in the fish other then this everything was goodabout   mins ride in tram no   from central station and well worth the travelling time they grow and supply organic vegetables for the restaurant all dishes taste superb the restaurant is set in a glasshouse in the centre of a lake we were enjoying the dishes while looking at the grass swaying gently outsidethe food was so natural and delicious and the service was sooo efficient the place itself is also gorgeous will definitely returnset in a park a glass greenhouse with edibles growing just inside the door an auspicious beginning the waiter was very happy to accommodate my request for a vegetarian meal and it was glorious savored every exquisite bite friendly service beautiful ambiance and a simply gorgeous dinnerthis restaurant is a must visit in amsterdam it s a little way out of the city but we rented bikes and had a lovely ride out there for our lunch we did the set menu and every item served was perfect and unique the food was   fresh and every bite had a really interesting mix of flavors i loved walking around the outside and seeing the garden where a lot of their food is grown you can tell a lot of care is put into the preparation i also appreciated that it didn t feel pretentious everything was explained to us and the staff was very friendly it s a little pricey but the location design of the restaurant and quality of the food is totally worth itthis is our second time at this lovely restaurant a great concept with greenhouses adjoining the restaurant everything is fresh and i believe the produce is all organic everything is grown there or locally acquired service is outstanding the food is excellent and very unique it will make you love vegetables if you don t already but don t worry they serve meat as well we will go back whenever we visitwe did our research before we went and de kaas kept popping up the venue looked stunning the food offering described as unique the reviews generally all favourable so pedalling over to this park greenhouse did it live up to expectations it surpassed and more sunny amsterdam evening sitting outside overlooking their beautiful park herb garden sheer heaven service exemplary food epicurean delight of several courses and exquisite wines to accompany price better not to ask an absolutely memorable evening at a truly magnificent and unique restaurantbe ready for a new experience no menu as the food is dependent on the fresh ingredients they get from there green house and farm but i have to say i loved it the food is so fresh and service is goodit s a fantastic place with warm and very friendly service and great food i loved the greenhouse atmosphere with the nice lighting when the sun went down the food was very good quality perhaps not the best i have ever eaten but certainly very well tasting the wine list was ok but of course rather pricey definitely my favourite place in amsterdam so fari cannot fault this place food was so fresh perfectly prepared and wonderful surrounding i cannot fault it and that is saying something don t miss thislovely restaurant in a converted greenhouse glasshouse held a conference dinner in one of the private rooms the food was truly fabulous all fruit and vegetables are grown in the greenhouses the service was very good would love to returnwent for our anniversary and had the chefs tasting menu it was all delicious most veg is grown in the greenhouse our sorced locally you can really taste the freshness the restaurant is within a converted industrial greenhouse and finished to an impressive standard looks pretty stunning at nighthe food is excellent and the food are individually well coordinated a very good wine list the staff is freundlich die entire ambiente good place to eatde kas is such a beautiful restaurant situated slightly off city centre of amsterdam however going to de kas is still not very difficult with the wide coverage of trams and buses you can easily visit by taking tram   to hogeweg de kas is just in front of you once you alight from the tram there is no menu it all depends on what are the harvest from the farm for the week all you have to do is to decide if you d like to have two or three course meals or three small dishes or just the main dish life is full of surprises but it s too bad for you if you re a picky eater you have no control at all for what you will be served do let the waitress recommend you suitable wines to go along with the menu of the day trust them fully and you ll get a perfect match the food can be a bit bland for some people but i think it s perfect as you can taste the freshness of the ingredients i ve never like beetroot but i ve fallen in love with the beetroot we were served it can be a little warm if you dine here during the day as it is a glass house however the lighting was perfect for photography nice food photos during the day for more details do visit the entry in my blog http photocautious blogspot sg     from farm to plate at de kas htmli had been here before but now my best friend and i took our mums here for mother s day we had an amazing   course meal with wine that was carefully selected to go with the dish the food is not only of outstanding quality it s also all grown by de kas themselves or they got it from local organic farmers and butchers will definitely come back herethe menu is fix they offer what they have available in their farm and greenhouse service atmosphere and food quality are excellentthe title of my review says it all fab visited here for my partners birthday we booked the chef table what am amazing experience from the minute you walk in you are made to feel very welcome by the chefs and out front staff we had about   courses which are all paired with lovely wines as each course is served the chef that cooked it they would come over and explain what the dish was and how it was made every dish presented so well all so pretty and colourful who knew all the different things you can make with vegetables then you get a tour of there amazing gardens where all there produce is grown for your final two courses you sit back in the main restaurant a converted green house what can i say an amazing night a must if your in amsterdamgreat concept the restaurant is surrounded by its own glasshouse and vegetable gardens food is good but i would not rate it as amsterdam s bestthe food was really good fixed menu but the experience is due to the wonderful location and view the vegetables that they grow and the good atmospherede kas is located in a greenhouse light and comfortable they grown their own vegetables around the restaurant and lots more in the local area you do not eat a la carte you can choose between menu starters main dish which is changed every day the veggies are prepared in a fine and unexpected way very delicious and uncommonset within a large greenhouse that was originally the amsterdam municipal nursery most of the meal is prepared from fresh organically grown produce from their own greenhouse or bought in from neighboring farms it was a set menu with small personalized changes to suit personal dietary requirements my husband had asked them to arrange a special champagne which they gladly did the meal was extremely fresh and tasty with special emphasis on the home grown vegetables our waiter was superb and a great evening was enjoyed by us all definitely worth going to but you should book in advancemy wife and i visited this restaurant recently while it has been on our list for a couple of years we just never quite got around to go there it s conveniently located by both public transport and car and the spot is really beautiful immediately when you arrive you get soaked into the pure and local experience that this restaurant is known for the hostess tells about the vegetables and herbs they produce themselves in their own kas we were seated near a place where they have a large table for i guess     people which was not used that evening that place is slightly separated from the rest and also contains a wine bar and a fire place quite nice if you ask me the food then every week or so the menu changes completely and is always based on a couple of basic principles as local as possible if they don t grow it themselves they use farmers that are close by inspired by the season and of course as fresh as possible although this is quite an expensive and high level restaurant it doesn t feel like it in general the staff is friendly and helpful but you do notice the way the restaurant is positioned reflects on the prices don t expect to spend less than     per person if you want to enjoy a good wine as well but it s well worth it the only reason i don t give it   stars is because our main dish was based on chicken it was delicious but looking at the fixed menu price the week before or after people might have gotten a nice steak or salmon for instance which is basically the only complaint not so much the fact you cannot choose what is being served but that this isn t reflected in the price at allas others have mentioned the place itself is so lovely and we were there while the sun was setting so the lighting evolved and became another element of the experience and again as others have stated there is a standard and set menu because of the time of year we were there april the preponderance of items were root vegetables fennel soup roasted celeriac the main course of cod came with beets although the food was tasty we would have preferred a less limited menu or wished for a different time of year with different choicessituated in a green house off centre of amsterdam in a pleasant surrounding you will be served a single   courses menu with home grown fresh seasonal ingredients all the dishes were visually pretty and full of flavours book in advance to avoid disappointmentfabulous restaurant with excellent settings found this restaurant on the internet and booked it   months in advance i emailed them to say that we are vegetarians and that my husband does not even eat eggs they remembered when we arrived that s   months after booking the good thing is they served nice veggie food but would not go there very often it s nice to try out once the staff were informative about each course they brought to our table and conversed with us in a good manner because i mentioned that we had gone there for our  th wedding anniversary they surprised our desert with chocolate writing of congratulations and   yearswe were excited to try this restaurant since it was so highly rated the setting is very pleasing to the eye and the actual restaurant is very nicely appointed we went on a friday evening around     pm and we didn t leave until     pm we ordering the prix fixe menu and yes there are   small appertizers but to wait over an hour for our main course is totally unacceptable the only reason we left at     was because we had a train out very very early the next morning so i had to ask for them to expedite dessert the food was good but i can easily say that we had better food during our stay in amsterdam in doing research for this restaurant i never came across the words slow food movement if that s what they are or want to be that should be identified so people know if we were to return to amsterdam any time soon we would not make a return visit to this restaurant no matter how local the food and also beware of the cost cost shouldn t be a factor for bad serviceexceptional place with dedicated people both in the kitchen and on the floor fixed menus inspired by the seasonwhen we arrived the view was beautiful a nice glass house with a greenhouse and stuck to it a large restaurant with lighting that changes color when asked for the menu our attendant answered if we d like to accept the chef s suggestion a surprise menu with a little trepidation we accepted and it was the best thing we did entrances to dessert everything was great with new flavors and delicious combinations although the quantities served in each dish are small we left quite satisfied i will certainly return to the site but i not indicate to whom only have space on the agenda for the old cuisinefabulous restaurant with incredible food exceptional service and a beautiful setting i had this place recommended to me by a friend and as i was in amsterdam for my birthday with my mum we chose this place for a little birthday lunch celebration we certainly weren t disappointed with a daily menu depending on which seasonal ingredients are available and matching wines for each dish everything about this place was perfection the pièce de résistance was the beautifully presented birthday deserta greenhouse located in the center of one of amsterdams beautiful park this restaurant breaks all norms from growing all their vegetables and herbs on site to a single set menu each week to an incredible setting you an not go wrong food is exquisite and must be planned for days in advance as the waiting list to dine is extensive enjoyfantastic place very exciting eating a menu when you don t know what you are going to get everything tasted good and had high quality friendly and informative staff highly recommanded restauranta great spot on a sunny afternoon definitely glad we had lunch rather than dinner just in terms of enjoying the greenhouse effect light and airy with delicious fish courses and some pretty good wine extremely friendly staff helpful and efficient but by no means all over you in fact they were a bit slow with our main course but it was no chore to wait it s a surprise what you eat which appeals to me as i tend to chose unwisely possibly slightly expensive but couldn t fault the experience we left feeling well fed and energised and a little bit poorer best olives everthis restaurant was on the top of my list to go to and it did not disappoint i went for lunch which is only available on weekdays with my family you need to book in advance the menu is set but they cater for allergies etc we had our lunch inside and then went outside for our coffee dessert after which was suggested by our waitress as it was a beautiful day food and drinks are sourced locally as much as possible and staff are able to explain where products are from e g own garden or affiliated farm you can wonder around the gardens in and around the greenhouse we had a two year old with us and staff were very friendly towards her and attentive they brought colouring pens and paper and suggested apple juice which came in a small bottle with the lid still on in which they punched a hole for the strawthis restaurant is located in a very large green house located within an amsterdam city park they grow most of their vegetables and a lot o the fruit service is attentive and jovial food is quite inventivethe location inside a greenhouse is pretty amazing in itself the food matches the expectations and the athmosphere is quite unique loved it they introduced us to some very tasty local wines the only negative was that i really wanted to have had the chefs tablewe booked this restaurant a week before we visited with friends from belgium making it a party of   the restaurant is in a green house set in a park and it was freezing the evening we arrived and i was hoping we would be warm we were and the welcome was warm too the food is sourced locally on site as well as in their field further away from the park the food was very good and generous we all thought we could not eat the large desert portion but we all did when we left we took one of their apples so we continued to enjoyed the hospitality the day after really good would definitely returnwe come from cities where local fresh and organic are the staples in restaurant cooking de kas really steps up to the competition the food was original fresh and delicious we are vegetarians who eat fish when traveling and they completely matched our expectations for a wonderful dinner make sure to asks about the architectural changes they made to adapt the simple greenhouse into this environmentally savvy building that helps produce some of the restaurant s food sources a real unique meal experiencewe had dinner at de kas kas is greenhouse in dutch the food was fresh and seasonal they have a set meal which changes with the products they receive from the farm every day we has a fish soup that was both tasty and hearty fresh herbs brought the fresh flavors of the fish out we also had a lamb dish which included mint we had some vegetables that were new to us but also enjoyable the service was great and the noice level was low the only weakness was the quality of the wine pairings go enjoyde kas a year ago was one of the top few restaurants in amsterdam i managed to snag a last minute reservation the day before and thank heavens that materialised this restaurant grows their own stuff and if not possible sources it from ethical farms or companies i arrived a little early at this glass house in a park just about   minutes out of amsterdam as it was a beautiful day we were invited for an aperitif in the garden where they grew their own herbs and vegetables i was left to spend some quiet time with my other half and at no time did i felt rushed to finish my drink and the snacks the waiter came by to check if we had any dietary restrictions there aren t any menus and whatever you are gonna eat that day is up to the whim and fancy of the chef and whats in season if you do not eat something this is the time to tell them like no cucumber coriander onion or whatever and they would take note and ensure its not inside for a fixed price you get   hors d oeuvres a main course and a dessert wine pairing is possible at an additional cost to put it simply it was an experience i would take with me to my grave the price is not mind blowing and you would have enough spare change for that tram ride back into the city eat here and make sure you set a side     hours for it to experience the place the food and the art of making everything just sublimegreat location in a large greenhouse type building in a park by a river   min cab ride from the centre of amaterdam not for the overly fussy eater as there is only a set menu but what it lacks in choice it makes up for in freshness vegetables grown on site and imagination friendly service and nice atmosphere made up of well to do tourists and the amsterdam chattering classes not cheap but very good even had a lovely children s menu for my fussy   year old daughter if they can keep her happy they must be doing something rightmy boyfriend and i had been recomented the place we had high expertations and they delivered lovely restaurant exxelent food and service we even got a tour around the greenhouses and the story of the place from the owner i will be back for a evening dinnermy boyfriend and i recently went for dinner at de kas the space is beautiful if a little chilly designwise for my taste i love the idea of the all the fresh food and that it is grown on site very inventive and creative our biggest complaint would be the slow service lots of staff running around looking busy but doing nothing certainly not coming by our table at one point in time my boyfriend had to tackle a server and ask her where ours was i know that we are not alone in this as the tables on either side of us felt the same one american the other scottish and we are canadian worth a visit but just go forewarnedtake fresh organic produce grown on site or their local farm and add the skill to present them table side with imagination and flair to enhance all the flavors in providing a gastronomic delight i ll tell you what this was a great meal get the wine pairing your taste buds will thank you very nice staffi ve been to de kas twice now once a few years ago i came for a business dinner the food was superb the service attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is wonderful last night thanks to gift from a friend my wife and i had the chance to try the chef s table you sit inside the kitchen talking with the chefs and see how everyone s meal including your own is put together although the chef s table is certainly not something most people can afford to do it s worth doing at least once in your life you don t need to sit at the chef s table to have a great experience but you can see from inside the kitchen just what makes de kas such a wonderful place to enjoy dinner they start with diverse locally sourced ingredients typically seasonal they handle the ingredients expertly and try to unlock new experiences with familiar ingredients they look at what s available at the standards they require and develop the menu weekly to best highlight something special about each ingredient this approach is best highlighted by this week s small celeriac dish they served a slice of lightly cooked and seasoned slice of celeriac with a puree of celeriac and a granola also made of celeriac each treatment made you think differently about something familiar the puree for example highlighted the nuttiness in a way the granola didn t each treatment unlocked a new experience in something you ve had a hundred times each dish we enjoyed was both familiar and surprising and everything from start to finish was unfailingly excellent the chefs work under high pressure and to high standards but somehow remain friendly and relaxed throughout if a timer goes off that requires someone to step away from one task invariably a teammate swoops in to complete the task without a pause a piece of fish that flakes into pieces while plating is laughingly and effortlessly transformed by the team into a unique and new dish for one of the staff to enjoy they are obviously a tightly knit team who share a great love of food and of the craft of preparing and serving food on that note the service and dining experience are also incredible our server was friendly attentive and greatly knowledgeable about the wines the pacing of the food delivery is perfect and not by accident from the kitchen you can see a master chart with the stage each table is at and any special requirements wave after wave of courses are completed assembled and delivered just in time the last dish to be delivered is prepared literally within seconds of the first the atmosphere is also wonderful and you can appreciate both the fading sunlight and the surrounding gardens from nearly every seat in the house in short de kas provides a world class dining experience that is always new and fresh but consistently greatthe restaurant is situated in a local park therefore the surrounding is very nice the concept of changing menus is well implemented the dishes offer a nice variation even though you may not like everything the service is great and so is also the atmosphere it doesn t feel posh and you can really enjoy a good time herean intriguing place this the concept is an interesting one in that there is no menu they just serve   courses based on what they have prepared though they will change this if you have dietary requirements this works well if you like what they serve the food we ate was very well cooked but there were some odd flavours in there so whilst i d happily eat the lamb course again and again the picked fennel was something i hope never again see on my plate of the   course we ate   were brilliant one was ok and the  th just plain odd the   appetizers were also a     split in odd and wonderful it s worth remembering this before you visit as even as someone who will basically try anything i struggled with pickled turnip on reflection i m pretty sure i d go again but you have to have an open mind and be prepared for some non standard stuffde kas is a special place where people goes to enjoy food real food organic available only following seasons rules and love i went there with a friend to celebrate my birthday i knew you had to made a reservation at least a couple of days before despite the wedsneday the restaurant was plenty of people go there if you want to satisfy your taste end eye price between     euro p p   courses and   euro for the super luxury dinner including cheese   courses     wine qualitiesthis is the best meal i had in amsterdam and elsewhere for a while we just went over easter for lunch at de kas it was all perfect the food was excellent the venue amazing and the service perfect the restaurant is set in a former greenhouse located in a lovely little park making the experience unique the food from starter to desert was excellent and surprising as left to the chef s will using seasonal ingredients the service was spot on too and the dishes explained to us as they were served a great place to go and go againmy wife and i recently spent our  nd wedding anniversary at the chef s table at de kas restaurant the meal exceeded our expectation in every way quality service and value most of the ingredients are either grown at the restaurant or nearby at their farm the flavors and freshness reflected the organic nature of their efforts the chef s table experience was worth the effort scheduling early after   courses each personally described to us by the preparing member of the staff we were given a personal tour of the facility and restaurant and then finished our final three courses sitting in the main open spaced dinning room everyone from the host wait staff and head chef was down to earth and genuinely interested in providing and outstanding dinning experiencewe live in las vegas and frequent high end cuisine this type of dining experience would be double the price in the states or more the   minute taxi ride from the center of amsterdam was well worth the effort i was very impressed by the staff and the standard of food they prepareabsolutely creative food vegan type made with fresh product dedicated and friendly service with reasonnable price should be nice at lunchvery nice restaurant lovely settings and tasty food friendly staff good service without being pompous would definitely go back which is the ultimate test in our booksthis restaurant is superb from the building to the interior design to the food it s pure perfection for more pictures and commentary check out comthis place must be stunning on a sunny spring day we were there on a spring day when it was raining sideways but i m still glad we went servers were very willing to address food allergies can t have corn and restrictions don t eat meat or foul i don t think i missed out on anything as we had a beautiful mushroom soup followed by a ceviche and a wonderfully flavorful salad made from celery root shaved to look like pasta then a main course of the most buttery fish i ve ever tasted and closed with a fabulous assortment of tiny dessert bites butter cake dark chocolate and a divine beet violet gellee the place was not crowded at lunchtime on a weekday but we did reserve online in advance just to be sure most other diners were businesspeople dressed in work attire we wore slacks and sweaters i think nice jeans would be ok so long as one looks tidy for the evening i d probably dress a bit better but again slacks and a sweater would dothe meal was superbe creative original and full of refined flavours service was remarkable the whole experience including the setting really top one of our best means in amsterdammaybe we ve been spoiled by amazing chefs and restaurants around the world but we were not blown away by the food here service was slow and inattentive even for europe the food was mediocre relatively bland and uninteresting it was fresh though space was beautifulthe food wine was fantastic   euros for   people with   bottles of wine costing   euros or so each no ala carte instead a delicious set menu was offered no food decisions necessary everything was   fresh much of it from their own gardens   mins outside central amsterdam take a cab there and back and enjoy a feast here the restaurant is located in a huge buzzing greenhouse with a great atmosphere the staff were well trained friendly and spoke english perfectly and many displayed a very english dutch sense of sarcastic humour which we enjoyed my party had a great time there we shall definitely returnwent with a group and a pre selected six course menu of some of the most creative food combinations i have ever had for example carrot canneloni was made using wide strips of carrots instead of a pasta roll each vegetable and fruit was extremely flavorful and perfectly seasoned and cooked the tiny roasted brussels sprouts served in a bowl as a pre meal snack were addictive and a healthy alternative to chips each course had an unusual but flavorful surprise and the staff happily answered questions as we tried to guess ingredients a pectin jelly had red pepper rhubarb and cinnamon intense flavor and the perfect between course palate cleanser the building is a large greenhouse set in a park like setting and the glass walls keep you from feeling crowded in a unique place try itthe restaurant itself is the star here it is a converted glasshouse situated in a lovely wooded park which is accessible only by foot the decor is modern fresh and the table layouts are well done while it was freezing outside the inside temperature was just right the staff were also a highlight very friendly and knowledgeable now for the negative we thought the food was not matching the quality of the restaurant i understand the concept of using local fresh produce but i thought the   course meal was lacking slightly in flavor the presentation was excellent for all courses but my taste buds were let down at   euros starting price for the   courses i expected much more this restaurant could be world class if the menu could be tweakeda half hour trip on the number   tram from centraal station this restaurant is very smart and spruce in a glasshouse complete with storks nesting on top of a nearby pillar in the park beyond it seats a large number of people and this does keep noise levels relatively high i wouldn t count this as a romantic location service was great the food was very good but not quite a five given the cost i would eat their again but there are better restaurants in amsterdam in my opinionwe ate here and had a private dining area for   of us for a friends  th from the moment we walked into the restaurant we were taken aback by the setting and attention to detail we opted for the set menu which is kept a secret until it is bought out to the tables we also had wine pairings for each course our tastebuds were taken on a fascinating journey through the courses we were not over fed like with so many set menus instead the food was well prepared with a focus on flavours and quality we all particularly enjoyed the waitresses descriptions of each dish and discussion of where the food was grown and how many food miles we would be eating a true gem to be explored and visitedenjoyed dinner at de kas on a wednesday evening we were unable to book on the restaurant website but our hotel concierge sorted a table at short notice no menu but a special chef s presentation of what is in season at the time inventive creative ever so tasty food we had the accompanying wines which went very well with the food the dining room is visually impressive and even though it was a weds evening there was a good buzz in the place i can imagine it s packed thurs fri and sat my only gripe is the service which was friendly but slow however it was pointed out to me that life in amsterdam is generally very laid back c est la viethe location was an oasis of calm beside a little canal you d think you were in the countryside yes even in the heart of amsterdam you cross a little bridge and step into the ambience of a nursery farm the building was a greenhouse transformed into an elegant and modern space roomy open simple clean bright straight forward and meltingly warm on the cold night when i was there all was of top quality including the table linen and service the food was exceptional and unusual i was inspired to eat slowly to savour the unexpected combinations the unique flavours were varied and complex several of the food items were new to me the underground root portion of the chicory for example the chef understood what it is to build a diet from plants this was so terribly satisfying even relieving for me as a vegetarian the food all originates from the greenhouse next door or from the larger greenhouse close by where the restaurant owner tends the crops and brings in the harvest every morning organic fresh delicious it was fun to be able to watch the busy kitchen behind the glass wall while eating service was friendly and professional i loved being able to tour the greenhouse and taking an organic apple proffered in the huge bowl as i left this restaurant is a good choice for a special occasion when you have something to celebratewe likes the restaurant a lot interior is interesting food is very tasty one of the best places in amsterdam very nice service very attentive wine selection wad quite good it was the first restaurant in the city we have visited and was impressive right away i recommend this place highlyhaving been on the fence about whether to de kas for a few years i finally decided to book a table for the third visit i wish i had seen what i am about to write before i made the decision the walk thru the park to get to the restaurant was delightful with many different types of birds around side note they seem to be a bit early in freezing beginning of march the restaurant was beautiful what is worse a restaurant that doesn t care or one that thinks it is doing great things i will give the staff at de kas benefit of the doubt and give them credit for trying although the service was at the same time polite and indifferent almost as soon as we sat down we were given olives and another dish of mustard marinated mini brussel sprouts feeling peckish we started to eat and they were tasty the mustard pairing was nice the olives seem to have been marinated in something zesty nice we were given an explanation of how the tasting menu worked it was already chosen for us first course was a light soup that came in two parts ingredients in a bowl and then broth poured over from a glass teapot at the same time a small plate of sweet potato crisps were brought out so far so good the soup might have been a bit light in terms of ingredients quantity but it was curiously tasted and beautifully presented and soon finished it was immediately asked to be taken away but to our surprise the unfinished brussel sprouts and crisps were also removed but not the olives next came a salmon dish with an arrangement of vegetables and creamed blue cheese not a common combination but worked ok the salmon was meant to be cooked on the outside slightly raw on the inside i felt they had taken it off the heat too soon the fish was practically raw with the outside just seared considering it is smoked fish they are off the hook but it could have been nicer the dishes were hurriedly removed and suddenly there was nowhere for me to place the very large olive stone i was left with on the white tablecloth or in the napkin on my lap they have also not done anything about the empty bread basket we ate our   slices we waited and started to wonder if that was the full meal we checked our menu again to reconfirm   courses or   courses eventually another fish dish was brought to us only now were we asked whether we wanted more bread given that the main was there we no longer needed to fill our time with bread this main dish worked well for me because the fish was cooked tender and very tasty with the capers anchovies and mashed potatoes i just thought it was unusual to serve two fish dishes in a row the menu would have worked better with a meat starter or all vegetable starter or skip the salmon altogether and give dessert instead we did not feel the meal was worth   euros if the issues listed above were fixed then maybe i d pay   euros next time lots of potential of a restaurant but management will have to act if they want to be above average when we left the restaurant we saw a mouse running out in the opennot too far from the heart of amsterdam is the lovely frankendael park cross the little bridge that takes you into the park and you will find a delightful restaurant greenhouse the ambience is superb and ideal for anything from business lunches to social dinners with friends the food is top quality and the produce picked directly from the greenhouse is incredibly fresh the restaurant offers a very good wine list i always try and drink local wine while travelling and so we selected an absolutely delicious fresh lively and fruity white dutch wine we had the surprize lunch menu proposed by the chef that included three starters a couple of main dishes and a fantastic dessert a kind of mousse with different layers of fruit and chocolate i have definitely added de kas restaurant to my must go places to eat in amsterdamthere s not much to say about perfection food wine service fresh produce all local for a unique dining experience inside what looks like a glasshouse de kas is where you want to go pricey but worth itunusual is the word that would desribe the best my dinner there it s pretty hard to explain how they cook but it s an unusual combination of tastes and products unexpected but a very pleasant surprise even the wine was unusual i ordered a sancerre that did not taste like the classic sancerre as it was a non filtered wine service is very good and location unusual price wise i find de kas reasonable considering the quality you get and also the quantity   more or less small different dishes as starter and the main course was generous service was very good book it and experince yourself i m sure you ll be surprised and not disapointedwe had lunch at this restaurant easy to reach by no   tram from centraal the food is locally sourced and quite delicious each component was excellent however sometimes it was hard to follow the story of the dish a stand out was the beautiful smoked salmon almost mousse like texture and also the ginger and carrot soup starter with blue cheese ravioli the service was friendly and efficient everything was explained well the setting is extraordinary in a greenhouse in a park quite lovelya no   tram ride from the centre of town will see you into a little park square in one corner is de kas a greenhouse the staff were excellent even providing the recipe for the roasted and marinaded sprout starter the food is what the chef decides and all of it was to die for we had lunch with dessert and wine it is not cheap but it is good value for money the range of flavours and the juxtapositions of ingredients were really a marvel of ingenuity by the chef it was great to see them slaving away in the kitchen shame we hadn t booked to eat in there perhaps next time a very pleasant   hours partly spent learning that beetroot as part of a dessert does work if you like fine dining in unusual surroundings this is the place for youif you are looking for exceptional food and unusual interior this is a place to go in amsterdam the name translates into english as greenhouse and it is a perfect description of the restaurant the interior looks very modern and upscale much better than i expected despite the fact that a part of the building is a real greenhouse where they grow produce for dinner they only serve a three course set menu and you don t know what your courses are the food was outstanding of excellent quality i loved the juicy and tender veal as well as the starters the desert was good too but the beetroot in it was not to my taste i highly recommend this restaurant and deserves a micheline stari have to start out by saying this has always been one of my favorite dining experiences my husband and i were recently in amsterdam and were quite excited about going back to de kas but sadly we were very disappointed from the beginning the appetizers were tasteless and the vegetables were over cooked we also did the wine pairings and we re not impressed by those either the restaurant is beautiful both in the day and evening but sadly i don t think we will be going backi ate here twice and found it extremely nice it is a big space with excellent service staff are really helpful from reception to table service and food wine recommendation the first time i went we also did a tour of the place it was really special prices are high but you can control that with the menu selection absolutely recommend it for any occasion whether it s business or a romantic mealwe went here as a special treat for my mother and sister we traveled from eindhoven and it s easy to get to by public transport which was nice as we all could enjoy the wine the atmosphere is fantastic and the concept great we are into local food so it pleased us we started with local bubbly wine which for me was the only not so good part of the whole dinner there is no menu which i found oddly calming no choice angst this time what particularly struck me was the extremely pleasant acoustics despite the size of the room it felt intimate it was easy to hear the rest of our   people party and we never heard the conversations of neighboring tables a real gemwe went there for a business event excellent atmosphere which suits this occasion but also for an evening out with your partner the service is top and the food good definite a place to come backwe had a fantastic meal here for our first wedding anniversary lovely table great food good service yummy chicory soup starter tasty beetroot homemade pasta sweet fresh homegrown carrots heaven for a vegetarian blood orange sorbet really delicious though i d suggest this is more of a standalone desert perhaps one flavour sensation too many with the chocolate crumble beetroot and vanilla citrus foam presentation excellent only down side was that it took a while to get the bill at the end of the meal no drama just slow when you re ready to leavenearly forgot the place but now definitely back on the map had a party for two and our anniversary to celebrate and had bubbles as an aperitif and guess what the bubbles were dutch and delicious the concept of de kas restaurant nursery is that the food is prepared with the freshest local ingredients and they grow their own herbs and vegetables in the greenhouses and gardens at the restaurant and on their farmland in the beemster area there s a set menu based on the daily harvest supplemented with the best additional ingredients from local suppliers and you re asked whether you re are vegetarian flexitarian like we are or whether you ve got a food allergy great staff and service in a great location a huge greenhouse which dates back toi always visit de kas when in amsterdam if you book in a feew months ahed you might get the shef s table this is the greatest food eksperience i have ever had and im a food stalker the service the fresh food the place by the park what can i say the staff is also amazing and realy takes care of you love this place dmy partner and i had the distinct pleasure of dining at de kas yesterday for lunch i ll admit their straight forward fixed menu worried me slightly at first but we were asked for food likes dislikes and any allergies and the menu was altered to meet our directions all of the food was presented beautifully and the wine pairings optional matched each course nicely the space is done beautifully keeping the original architectural elements of the greenhouse but adding eco friendly solar panels and lighting each of the staff were friendly and helpful all of which contributed to our very enjoyable experiencesomelier exceptional service adequate but questions about clearing and service standards food was tasty no wow factor venue is beautiful and the hosts exceptionally friendly but there was a lack ownership passion and commitmentthis is a well known place in the netherlands i wanted to visit since a long time but only recently managed to do it i loved every bit of it the atmosphere is unique dining in a glasshouse the staff was very friendly in casual way and the food was delicious we had duck as main course which was one of the best dishes i ever ate so tasty the restaurant is a bit out of town but easy to reach with a taxi it s definitely worth the trip i can highly recommend itwe made a booking at de kas based upon a recommendation in a lonely planet guide we were a little hesitant as it looks a little pretentious and half expected to feel out of place thankfully we were largely incorrect and proved wrong it s a little out of the centre in an unlikely neighbourhood but the park itself is a perfect setting after walking past the greenhouses we were greeted by very friendly staff and shown to our table in the middle of the large greenhouse the menu options consisted of a three course fixed price menu or a more expensive menu including a number of complementary wines as we aren t big drinkers were opted for the first option the menu choices were at the chef s discretion and we were happy to be surprised the first course consisted of dishes containing pumpkin beetroot and venison the main course was primarily veal and fennel for dessert we had a small ginger cake with a carrot sorbet each course tasted absolutely fantastic all of the flavours were really intense and shone through for drinks we opted for the house wines one of us red the other white they were great choices and went well with the food simply this restaurant is superb sure it s a little pricey but as a treat it can t be missed some of the clientele are definitely not the sort of people i d site down and have a pint with maybe my issue but for the food and experience don t think twice and the staff are greatthis is the second time we have been to de kas and it was as good as last time the decor and environment is stunning from black ceiling and neon lights to perfectly placed tables and fantastic tableware we had the full menu with accompanying wine and it was as fresh as it was pulled from the ground nothing is over cooked and tastes perfect they have a real knack of getting amazing flavours and textures from vegetables a must do when in amsterdamyou approach the restaurant through a slightly over grown in a nice way park eventually you come across what appears to be a glasshouse which turns out to be an amazing restaurant they have a large garden that supplies a lot of the food on the menu and a lot more is sourced from local farmers i guess because of this everything tastes extremely fresh there didn t appear to be any menus i believe the menu is altered daily and you get what you re given what we were given was five courses of mind blowing and unusual but delicious concoctions each course was accompanied by a wine match as well as a detailed description of the food by the most amusing and attentive waiter i ve ever met we were fortunate enough to begin our visit in the early evening when it was still light and as the meal went on we could watch the sky get darker sitting in a glasshouse rememberholy moly what a meal this restaurant will ruin vegetables for you forever this restaurant as you may already know is situated inside a greenhouse and their philosophy is all about locally sourced vegetables as the highlight to every meal their summer meals are   locally sourced and their winter meals are   locally sourced they grow a lot of the fruits and vegetables they use in the greenhouse as well as on a local farm run by the owners of this restaurant each meal is a fixed price   course meal highlighting local seasonal vegetables with available accomodations for allergies or other requirements the menu will change from day to day or week to week depending on what s available locally there is also an option for wine pairings   wines or   wines with each meal in addition there is an extensive wine list if you d like to order something a la carte the location is a bit south     miles from the central part of amsterdam but it s an easy bike ride on a nice day or taxi ride at night or on a cold day if you re wondering yes it totally is worth the trip there is plenty of bike parking right outside the restaurant if it s a nice day and you re early for your reservation or have some time afterwards it s a lovely walk around the greenhouse complete with a pond and a bridge and lots of greenery through a paved pathway the service here is wonderful and the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu items and where all the ingredients are sourced from the meal is served at a slow pace and each dish is introduced as it is brought out our meal for the evening started with some root vegetables then a soup two vegetable appetizers a main dish duck with vegetables and dessert rhubarb pie and compote with ice cream a delightful meal a wonderful experience you need to eat heremodern atmosphere diligent staff and excellent cuisine but we would love a little more warmth and some fanciness sometimes we enjoyed a fixed menu for lunch with extremely fresh ingredients mostly grown around the restaurant clever texture mixes perfect cookings and beautiful dish set up with also a nice choice of wines by the glass definitely a must see must do in amsterdam we would love to come back for dinner and enjoy the table in the kitcheni booked this for the special lunch for my partner and i it was a way out from the central hotel we were staying in in amsterdam although it s only a tram ride away and really easy to find we got there slightly early and they allowed us to come in and seated us it was a set menu which was ok although i probably wouldn t have ordered what was on the menu if i had the choice however i was glad it was that way afterwards the courses were simply divine it was full of different flavours and cooked to perfection the fact that it was all cooked on location is another adding benefit its set in a quiet park and you can sit outside and look over the flower beds and plots i cannot fault this at all it was a new experience for me and its certainly one that i would go back to it was amazing and if it was for trip advisor i wouldn t have found this hidden gem so thank you special occasions take treat your partner to this its something they wont forget in a hurry i certainly wontsometimes in life we forget that natural is essential and above all simple this is the most marked concept of kas surrounded by nature fresh natural ingredients are combined with excellent culinary direction allowing those clients enjoy and savor dishes of very high quality and supreme flavor a site should not miss in during your visit in amsterdambeautiful setting in the park in a wonderful light conservatory greenhouses everywhere which you re free to wander providing herbs tomatoes and peppers on arrival we were presented with delicious bread olives and marinated turnips selection of starters arrived together wonderful fennel dish roasted fennel fresh shaved fennel orange and edible flowers also a roasted vegetable i think with pepper and sweetcorn salsa one came with roasted lamb for the meat eaters and the other with miniature filo parcels for the vegetarian followed by an amazing tomato broth with sourdough croutons main coursesgrilled plaice with seafood courgettes pickled cucumbers courgette flowers pea shoots vegetarian similar with puff pastry things excellent dessert chocolate nemesis delicious wine especially dutch wine on arrival excellent experience fantastic light and right in the middle of a beautiful parkgroup spend few days in amsterdam for a break and decided to check out this restaurant which is slightly different from others by enlarge its ingredients are local from their garden very friendly team and hospitable excellent food and pics speak itself oh don t forget to check out their dutch champagnemy wife and i had dinner at de kas whilst visiting amsterdam for our  nd wedding anniversary from start to finish we had an absolutely amazing experience we were given a tour of the greenhouses which was full of a wonderful variety of their own grown produce each course was fantastic and the staff were courteous and polite we sat in the main greenhouse and it was beautifully lit with the dark outside the wine pairings all matched perfectly and i can not recommend it highly enoughwe visited on a bright sunny monday lunchtime in november so able to experience the lovely building and its parkland setting the menu is not cheap  euro for starter courses   dishes to share and   euro for main and we expected something wonderful from reviews but didn t get it our waitress barely smiled and we did not feel very valued as customers some snacks were on the table chunks of carrot lightly cooked but no very tasty dressing and enormous chewy green olives the starters were a jerusalem artichoke soup tasty enough with some chunks of octopus and   vegetable dishes to share one included brussel sprouts and the other a dark green cabbage i am one of the people who finds these very bitter genetics apparently and the   wedges of cabbage had been charred to a level of charcoal which was frankly unpleasant the main course was decent enough a generous portion of fish with some vegetables and a lemony sauce nothing special or outstanding no room for dessert wines by the glass were reasonably priced we have no wish to returnthe setting was amazing the atmosphere very relaxed the staff was very nice and quick to help and the food was honest and very tastfull very good price quality valuemy wife took me and our   children here while in amsterdam for a major birthday celebration and it was a great success the setting is unusual in a good way a wide high and airy dining room which is in reality a smart new greenhouse with modern furniture crockery and cutlery so at the other end of the spectrum from higgledy piggledy mix and match approach at the petersham nursery in richmond in the uk tables were well spaced apart and the whole area is lit with clean modern lighting all this just provides a lovely fun setting within which the delightful young waiting staff made us feel welcome and well looked after as we were served a highly original meal the   course menu is fixed our waitress offered to tell us what we were to have or let each dish be a surprise we chose the surprise and de kas suggested appropriate wine parings based on us only wanting two bottles in total there were three starter courses a main and pudding and each course was interesting tasty and unusual we think its nice to eat out somewhere that you eat something that you wouldn t cook better sometimes at home that s what de kas did in spades and all from produce that was they assured us locally produced in all de kas provided a fun meal in an unusual setting and we loved itthe place is very nice and unique unfortunately the food is disappointing we ve paid for   course menu     euros and received a bitter salad a chicken breast and a beat rout dessert that we just couldn t eathow great is it to eat food that is grown on site how great is it to eat food that doesn t make you feel guilty how great is it to eat food that you would never eat at home but that looks so simple to make and tastes so subtle how great is to eat delicate nearly totally organic food from a set menu in a stunning setting it is all great at de kaswhen in amsterdam go here don t think about it don t double check reviews just make a reservation and go it s fresh in season ingredients mostly from their own garden made into a dish created by the chef for that day the food couldn t be more perfect the restaurant is set on a the grounds of a park inside a green house great light in the dining room it s all glass and great decor very nicely done their approach to service is also pleasantly relaxed not inattentive just relaxed they were running around but didn t make us feel like things were rushed we sat there for     hours for lunch they spaced out drinks appetizers and entrees so perfectly that it didn t really feel like     hours i would generally be annoyed if my lunch took that long but they made it feel right and they were in no rush to get us out we could have easily sat there for another half hour without anyone bothering us overall i d highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner in amsterdam it s a little pricey but well worth the moneythe number   tram swishes you out of the centre of amsterdam past the tropenmuseum and on to the hogeweg tram stop from there you can see glittering coloured lights inside an amazing contemporary glasshouse in a park follow the footbridge over the canal and lights guide your path to the entrance inside to the left are crops growing including herbs and tomatoes the concept is simple farm to table either from the glasshouse here or their farm half an hour outside amsterdam the central dining glasshouse is large modern and comfortable with well placed and spaced tables the kitchen is open plan and you can see the brigade working away at the preparation and cooking the menu is a surprise in that they make the best of the available seasonal ingredients in a no choice menu but in our experience they accommodate effortlessly to dietary requirements like seafood allergies or diabetics there is also a wine pairing with the menu if you wish the staff are the key to the delivery of the quality experience and are attentive knowledgeable and positively delight in enthusing about each course as it is delivered we have been here a number of times in the last decade and always found the experience and the food positively excellent great ingredients served in imaginative ways through all the courses last time there was a lovely velvety jerusalem artichoke soup with squid delightful salads of beetroots and sautéed cabbage slices and mushrooms with enticing dressings and a superb pork loin main course the cheese course had some new varieties for me all in perfect room temperature condition then the dessert had the table oohing and aahing to conclude very special always busy so book ahead and will all restaurants have to be like this in the futurethis place is different from any place i have ever been very clean modern with very stilish food everything organic with different flavors menu is fixed therefore you are at the hands of the chef if you like to try something different this is the place prices are high but worth the experience we came today to celebrate my husbands b day and enjoyed every minutewe love farm to table concept especially when it involves an organic food reserve in advance as we had a had time getting reservation for dinner during our week s stay the ambiance is amazing its very unusual open and trendy loved their veges garden the menu was set so you don t get to pick but they do ask for your preferences so if you dislike something very much they will leave it out of the dish my husband is gluten free and they brought some nice gluten free bread since we were there in the fall beets were dominating our dishes which is fine with me as i like well prepared beets but it may not be to everyone s taste dishes had lots of veges and i love that but were not overly flavorful except for the desert the layered desert was so light and tasty with great fall flavor to it the service was great recommendations on the wine were ok it was fair priced for this organic food of this quality we would definitely return hereour travel guide has a small remark about an organic greenhouse restaurant a bit outside the city center where they grew their own vegetables our curiosity was instantly sparked to us that sounds like a perfect restaurant it was easy to get there with the number   tram from the center i ll say right away that the experience was above all expectations this is a serious modern well run restaurant worthy of at least one star in my opinion the setting inside a huge glass house inside a beautiful park was spectacular and next to to the eating area was the actual greenhouse where veggies were being grown the staff was professional and very friendly and helpful we had a really great time with our main waiter edwin who also took us on a tour of the greenhouse after our meal we took the   course set lunch menu together with the small wine tasting menu one glass for each course to start with though we couldn t resist when they asked if we wanted some dutch champagne from south holland it was really good made on the champenoise method with riesling grapes later we also tasted a dutch pinot grigio from limburg which was excellent the first course was a red beet soup with an oyster from zeeland this is a fantastic combination and i had already had something similar elsewhere but the de kas version was better than anything i had tried before heavenly afterwards we got a plate with various cooked vegetables in creative versions and sauces foams which were amazing the main course was a flat fish which was delicious with fantastic garnish the dessert was also super fresh and tasted great with some super tasty orange berries i had never eaten before it was a great meal which left us feeling invigorated and extremely content after we left we took a walk in the beautiful park the total for   persons including champagne aperitif and   glasses of wine each came to   euros well worth it the best meal i have had in a long timeon a recent visit to amsterdam my travel companions treated me to a birthday lunch at the highly recommended de kas i had no idea what to expect but what a breath of fresh air to experience a meal in the beautifully appointed light and bright restaurant with lovely park surroundings a warm welcome and attentive service by friendly and knowledgeable wait staff along with the most delicious and cleverly flavoursome food made this an occasion to remember i ll not spoil the surprise for you and let you discover this gem for yourself but suffice to say this is a must when visiting amsterdam one of the great restaurantsi travel a lot and love to explore a lot of culinary experiences then to live up to this title de kas must have to really deliver and it does discovered this place in   have been trying to go eat there once every season ever since of course since i travel a lot this is not always possible but they do strive to please and i am a huge fan the point of eating there every season is because they procure fresh seasonal locally grown ingredients so they vary according to the time of the year there is no set menu the produce of each day makes its way to the table cooked and blended skillfully with perfect complements also skillfully matched with wines if desired since the legend goes that they had a frequent guest who was vegetarian they have figured the veg option down to a t the service is exceptional and they are proud of their establishment this is clear a bit pricey but unforgettable for a special occasion or just for an indulgent extravagant mealin a renovated greenhouse inside a green park this is the hidden gem of the city the place is absolutely beautiful the food is more than perfect the staff incredibly polite and engaging it is quite expensive but it is definitely worth itgreat setting terrific service inventive cuisine limited selection ie no menu but very creative dishes would definitely returnrecently im more interested in the restaurants that show case local produce especially organic produce i love de kas concept of show case the vegetables from netherlands and the in season vegetables its the connection and love of the ingredients and the land that truly makes every dishes memorablewe had the matching wine with our food as well and had the best rose ive had in my life highly recommend this restaurant you wont regret it a must try in amsterdamfrom a to z this restaurant was a great experience with a little minus about its size very large creative fusion food with attention to details from a very interesting mushroom soup through a delicate salmon sashimi to grilled duck only the desert was below par spotless english servicearriving by cab we were impressed with the beauty of the large greenhouse in the park setting as you walk in the front door you can see all the beautiful plants growing inside the greenhouse that is where the positive experience ended we were taken to our table in the middle of the very large room we were a party of four most of the remainder of the tables in this room were set for six to twelve people as the room began to fill many large parties were seated all around us i was not aware that it was a fixed menu only you had a choice of two entrees and the starter and dessert were fixed the choice for the main course was duck or a white fish of some sort the only other option was a vegetable dish the couple we were dining with ordered the vegetarian dish because they didn t want to have the duck or the fish and so they found their vegetarian dish very unsatisfying the first course was a fish soup which was tasty the second course arrived and it looked pretty but it was full of beets which i don t eat and edible flowers i don t eat duck but my husband chose that and it was served blood rare and tough to chew i ordered the fish which was bland with almost no taste my fish plate was served with beets so i left them on the plate apparently there must have been an abundance of beets growing in the greenhouse because they were featured in the salad and the main courses the dessert was a scoop of homemade ice cream and little bits of broken up brownies sprinkled on the plate there was also a slice of pear and some pear puree on the dessert plate i suppose this was supposed to look fancy but it looked ridiculous you had to pick up the small bits of brownie with a spoon the presentation was completely unappetizing as we were leaving we walked by the kitchen which is open to view and the dishes were lined up all being plated exactly alike like you see at a catered event overall this restaurant was very disappointing and is very overrated dinner was expensive and definitely not worth the price we have friends that will soon be visiting amsterdam and we will strongly discourage them from eating in this pretentious restaurantvegetables direct from the restaurant s own land you can t get it fresher and you will taste the difference no menu you eat what the cook prepares wine is offered in line with the food the setting is an old large greenhouse absolutely amazing concept great service staff with eye for detail simply a must when you visit amsterdamthis is definitely one of the highlights of our dining experiences in amsterdam easy to get to with a taxi and it seems that the drivers all know about this special restaurant inside the garden wonderful experience to be in a huge glasshouse with lots of open spaces although it was chilly outside and not too much sunlight when we got there for lunch no menu in sight and the friendly waitress basically asked if there is anything that we don t eat i asked for a vegetarian option and she gladly said of course as they have their own garden and it is not a problem the pickled beetroot was very fresh and not sour at all and the dip was also good with bread the soup was wonderful and we also got   cold warm appetizers warm salad and vegetable lasagne very tasty even my husband was surprised with the freshness and taste from these vegetarian dishes the mains were a perfect white perch for my husband and risotta rolls for me both well executed and did not disappoint by the time we finished every single bit of food on our dishes we were stuffed and could not do the desserts we also had the chance to tour around the gardens and definitely could identify some of the greens from the garden on our plate top marks for all around prices were reasonable in our opinion euro   each for lunch with such high quality food and service i would certainly recommend any foodie to make a trip there to enjoy this special placeone of the best anywhere the attention to every detail shows in the finished product every dish was perfectly prepared and matched with wine the idea of using the freshest and in season with menu changing daily is one that is hard to find as you eat what the chef chooses worked for us better than having choices of less fresh food setting in a greenhouse in a park made this dinner over the topde kas came highly recommended from friends it lives up to it s reputation and then some beautiful space every course is a delight and the wine pairings are for sure a must it really feels like a walk through the garden fresh and delicious from beginning to end a an amazing experience compliments to the entire de kas teamtake your time make a reservation ahead of time go there and enjoy a delightful dinner with your friends it will cost you a little more than expected but worth every pennyits so easy for us all to get caught up in buying pre packaged foods take away and ready to eat meals in the hustle and bustle of our busy lives de kas is a perfect reminder for those of us who are guilty of the above of how much better home grown produce is from the beginning of the   course meal my boyfriend and i were shooting each other looks of delight from across the table that food was incredible we ate from the lunch menu which includes   courses the price is most definitely worth it we even ordered dessert after our main because we couldn t get enough of the flavours and the freshness and were so intrigued at the look of the beetroot and chocolate inspired dessert this is a must do in amsterdam hire a bike ride there from central take in the views of your surroundings and enjoy being able to look up at the sky while you have your lunch in the comfort of the greenhouse the staff were friendly the atmosphere was relaxing and elegant the food was divine what more could one ask for it ticked all the boxesit was such a pleasure experience to eat fresh tasty food in the huge green house i enjoyed so muchwe enjoyed every single moment every single spoon food is fresh and wow the service was attentive and friendly we were just a bit surprised at the bill nobody informed us on what was included in the menu just be aware that water wines and aperitive is not included once you know this just enjoyit was worth thrip by tram into the suburbs of amsterdam to find de kas we arrived early for lunch so had time to stroll around the vegetable gardens meticulously and interestingly laid out around the restaurant the interiors did not disappoint either providing a relaxing modern and enticing eating environment the service was efficient friendly and professional we chose a light lunch menu and were more than satisfied interesting combinations of ingredients and all fresh with a major focus on kms zero i will return for dinner next time as it was the most exciting and adventurous food experience we found in amsterdamde kas is the type of restaurant you go to on a special occasion everything about the restaurant is special the restaurant is in a greenhouse is in a beautiful park in the outskirts of amsterdam you walk about   yards from the road through the park over a bridge to the restaurant we made reservations about   weeks in advance by emailing the restaurant directly they confirmed and reconfirmed the reservation   times there is no menu and they will not even tell you what you are getting until it is served to you they only serve the freshest ingredients there is a   part starter hot and cold main course cheese course and dessert followed by petit fours all the food was delicious the portions are small but numerous so you will not go hungry the wine pairings were very interesting with wines from serbia bulgaria and other unique locations the service was amazing we had a main waitress but no less than   other servers came to our table during the meal taxi ride home was very easy they push a button give you a slip of paper with a number and the taxi arrives in about   minutes by far this is one of the best restaurants i have ever been toremarkable dining experience that absolutely lived up to it s advance reviews stunning sense of place lovely three corse menu featuring hake and a gorgeous soup starter paired with obscure but very well conceived wines from germany austria and italy we had a fresh highly energetic young waiter named edwin who helped make the experience so much fun dazzling from start to finish not to be missedi booked the chefs table for myself and my wife s   year anniversary all i can say is wow and i have eaten in some great restaurants in my time all of the kitchen team went out of their way to make us feel welcome and part of the kitchen we had a great view of the kitchen and were assaulted by various wonderful smells the food just kept on coming we lost track of the number of courses i think   or   in total we both were really full by the end it all tasted wonderful and was presented beautifully they also fully catered to my wife who is vegetarian the chefs table menu was slightly different to the main restaurant menu the setting is also stunning it is really easy to reach from amsterdam one final note although expensive for the experience i felt it was excellent value when i booked they quoted me a chef s table price which included matching wines i emailed them a few days prior to say my wife doesn t really drink and could they prepare some non alcoholic drinks they replied that this was no problem i think my wife must have still had at least half of the alcoholic pairings i fully expected to pay the original quoted price for both of us when the bill came i was pleasantly surprised to see that they had drastically reduced it and not charged my wife for any of the alcoholic drinks one of the best meal experiences of my lifeso far this has definitely been the best restaurant i have visited in amsterdam fresh delicious food great wine matches excellent service beautiful building in a lovely location it s a bit difficult to get to but well worth the effort book ahead there s no point just turning up this place is booked out i thought this was excellent value for money tooyes you can take the   tram from spui out to de kas in frankendael park but i am pretty sure that if you can afford   for dinner for two you can handle the   round trip taxi fare kidding aside this is a lovely restaurant and a wonderful overall experience well worth the trip to its site in the southeastern part of the city take your glass of wine and tour their greenhouse it s really just for show but you can see many of the vegetables and herbs they use in their dishes and grow in bulk on a plot of land outside the city the service was great like other top places in the city it is fixed price fixed menu with your choice of the number of courses the salad was incredible unbelievably fresh greens herbs and tomatoes the other dishes were in our view overly complex too many elements in each one see my current review of restaurant johannes same complex approach they will call you a taxi to take you back to your hotel no problem there dinner for two with   glasses of wine was aboutmy husband took me for lunch on the recommendation of a good friend de kas is easy to get to tram   from centraal station and has a glorious setting in a small park the venue is chic and understated the attention to detail faultless and the service and cooking of the very highest standard we enjoyed starters which were bursting with flavour and freshness and a main course chicken dish which zinged and had a terrific light vinaigrette dressing wine by the glass was well judged we shared a dessert plum cake fennel ice cream which was sensational although the surroundings and presentation are not as fussy the focus on local ingredients from the next door garden and greenhouse and the cooking and presentation which focused on the food itself reminded me of le manoir aux quat saisons i thought it was a terrific lunch and look forward to booking dinner there very soon i hopewe went here with friends whilst on a visit to amsterdam it did not disappoint service excellent food was wonderful would highly recommenddid a bit of research before we arrived in amsterdam and booked de kas a few weeks before glad we did we managed to increase our booking from   to   as friends came up from a the hague accessed it by a little bridge of the main road and was instantly in a calm serene park the huge glass greenhouse was so impressive and not a sound could be heard as we entered quiet we said to each but the acoustic were such that upon opening the door the buzz was warming the hassle of choosing is taken out of your hands and we had an amazing meal sharing starters of produce from the garden and greenhouse we were actually sat in we had a beetroot salad with three different types and another salad of fennel tomatoes and courgette warm soup with a piece of gurnard on top chicken cooked on the bbq served with wonderful tasty veg we had a selection of dutch cheese and a plum pudding with fennel ice cream we chatted the night away and we were the last to leave the kitchen is on view and you can wander into the greenhouse a huge bowl of apples are there for you to help yourself to on leaving and the chef asked us as we left what did you enjoy most the chicken i said and the soup and the cheese everything i said make an effort to visit you won t be disappointedde kas is known as amsterdams top gourmet restaurant make sure to reserve in advance the space is spectacular it s a huge glass house in the middle of a beautiful park they even have their own green house where they grow organic vegetables the decor is contemporary there is a lot of light and high ceilings just a great ambience the menu was eclectic and interesting hard to fully describe but there was heavy use of fresh vegetables delicious the wine selections were also excellent our kids loved the deserts too all in all a fantastic find dining experience with the localswe had heard about this place from the book where chefs eat and it was absolutely fantastic the non pretentious service the ambience and the food everything   star very reasonably priced fine diningwe ate at de kas earlier this month it was such a welcome relief from the noise and crowds in the city center my blood pressure went down as soon as we walked in the door you dine in a greenhouse in the park unlike some restaurants in amsterdam where you are dining on top of others the tables are nicely spaced the serivice was impeccable the menu is fixed price so if you do not have an adventurous palate this might not be the place for you i could have had just the bread and olives and been satisfied we had a fennel salad and although i am not a fennel fan i was eating the leftovers off my son s plate the soup was a bouillion which was good but not fabulous my only issue with the dinner was the main course of mackerel i thought this was an odd choice as it is very fishy and not recommended for pregnant women after one bite i decided that was enough the waiter noticed that i didn t like the fish and insisted that i have the meat alternative which was veal the staff took note that is was my son in law s birthday and they brought him a special dessert aside from the fish we had a wonderful experience at de kas and i highly recommend it be aware that it is a bit of a cab ride from the city center maybe   round triptake over a run down greenhouse convert half to grow your own veg and the other half into your own restaurant and you have a super hip combo highly recommend this restaurant it is very slick a bit off kilter and just great food enjoy the experiencevery out of the way for an amsterdam tourist approximately   euro cab one way fare from city center nice setting restaurant in a greenhouse where they grow their own vegetables meal is   course fixed which you can expand to include a cheeseboard the starter and first course were very good but the main entree was mackerel that was too fishy to eat since it was a fixed dinner we didn t know that we could ask for something else until we had finished the course would have been nice if server had shared that info with us ahead of time overall the fresh vegetables were fabulous and the setting very different i don t think i would return again qwe choose this restaurant as we read that it is among the most peculiar restaurants in the world the location is great indeed and very elegant as well as the waiters we had the menù with three entrees and one main course all of them where really good and tasty but very small portions the price is quite high for what you eat it is those kind of restaurants that you try once for the experience of eating in a gardeni have been lucky enough to visit de kas twice and i loved it on each occasion we started with a glass of house sparkling and wander through the herb garden followed by the three delicious courses we all loved it the flavours were delicately balanced the portion sizes perfect and we also opted for the wine matching which also added to the experience all the staff are friendly and welcoming which isn t always the case in places the calibre of de kas next time i m booking the chef s tablede kas a greenhouse converted into a restaurant is located in a gorgeous park walking distance   minutes from the train station we walked into the park by a side entrance with the greenhouse at a distance it was absolutely breath taking the atmosphere was warm and inviting the service was excellent and the staff goes out of their way to make sure your visit is pleasant they were very kind and called a taxi for us when it was time to depart we found the food to be fresh and delicious but it was not outstanding we had good food and wine but not gourmet dining it was a delightful experience nonethelessthis place is very unique since it is a greenhouse in which you as a guest are dining you can see the vegetables and fruits they are serving in their dishes there is one menu that fits for all also for vegetarians make sure you call them in time to make a reservation since they are always full it is quite expensive but worth every euro the service is great toomy boyfriend recently surprised me with a trip to amsterdam for my  th birthday and booked a table for the evening of my birthday to celebrate as he had seen some really good reviews on trip advisor when we were arrived we were greeted by a lovely lady who was really accommodating and showed us to our table a waiter then came to explain how de kas works and the surprise menu and asked if we had any food allergies neither myself or my partner have any allergies but my partner told him he didn t like fish and the waiter said no problem we were given olives bread and gerkins as an appetiser while we waited for the trio of starters which was great as we were really hungry and nice to nibble on while we waited   out of the   starters were delicious but the  rd was to neither of our tastes but thats more to do with us not liking zucchini for the main i had fish which was really tasty and not something i would usually pick off a menu they gave my partner veal which he said was amazing and the vegetables they came with i have to say were the best i ve ever tasted i mentioned to the waiter that it was my birthday and the chef himself bought out my dessert and he had written happy birthday on the plate with chocolate sauce which was a nice touch prices are reasonable considering its somewhere you would go for more of a special occasion would definitely recommend for people to try it out but not for picky eaters the staff are really friendly and accommodating and i m sure if you told them you didn t like something they would alter the dish to suite your tastes told all my friends and family about it on coming home to the uk and recommended if they go to amsterdam in the future that they try itmy partner and i were in amsterdam for a few days while travelling around europe and i saw this restaurant on a travel newsletter so i thought it would be a great splurge while in amsterdam the food was a set menu but all the food and ingredients were so fresh and so yummy that you would tell the food was grown with care in their garden we got to enjoy a lovely salad a nicely cooked fish and yummy cake for desert the beer my partner drank was also locally brewed which made the experience so much more important for the local communityas soon as we arrived the staff were so nice and greeted us with great smiles and really took care of us the decor of the restaurant also added to the experience as we got to enjoy the fantastic sun during the lovely long summers i would highlight recommend experiencing this restaurant and the great food it providesi love the freshness of the veggie which straight from their glasshouse very friendly and helpful staff and my daughter was even invited to make a visit to the kitchen and took photos with the chefsthis is everything a restaurant should be ethical food grown on the premises or locally sourced excellent service and even the chef came out to give a talk on the provenance of the food and shared both his enthusiasm and philosophy of the restaurant that he is clearly passionateaboutthe waiter was really brilliant and just there for us and was also clearly engaged in the whole processa real must if you are in amsterdami had high hopes for this place some of which were met but some were not the service is very good the entree was delicious as was the dessert though the latter was questionably presented the appetizers were a miss the soup which was a creme watercress with pork was good but i couldn t tell if it was meant to be served hot or just the luke warm that it was also it had large chunks of pork in it that made it inelegant to eat without trying to cut it the two salads were the most disappointing for me just random things thrown together that ultimately weren t the better for it however if there s one piece of advice i can give to the owners it would be to buy new dishes the ones they have are same that they use in my office cafeteria all beat up and of industrial quality and it really takes away overall from the experience if you re to be serving fine food it should be placed on high quality flat ware or at least ones that haven t been used for several years and are all scratched up overall i would still recommend it and the setting and ambiance are quite beautiful the wine pairing is a good value but the wines themselves are quite unimpressive the only nice thing is trying wines from areas where you wouldn t normally have them e g the netherlandsthe greenhouse is amazing and you are encouraged to walk around and check out what they have growing the staff are all very friendly and helpful the food is only good you get very little choice about the menu the main course for the evening was fish which i do not eat so i was offered beef dishes were prepared and presented well but the flavors were a bit bland the dinner was very expensive and much more than i would expect for the quality of food overall a nice dinner but i would not spend that kind of money there againfirst it s a really great space a greenhouse within a garden an oasis in urban amsterdam that said de kas appears to coast on its name and seems to be past its creative prime the food is passable the service is perfunctory and the waitstaff seem to have a script that they mumble as quickly as possible when you are seated we were seated in a subpar corner table but the waitstaff refused to seat us elsewhere even though the restaurant was half empty on a tuesday night in short this is an assembly line that seems geared to the out of towner who will likely never visit again i would caution the visitor to dig deeper and find better food in amsterdam certainly the value is low at this venue i was surprised by our poor experience given other reviews i ve read too badi came here on business so i can t speak to the price however the food was very good the concept is admirable and attractive everything you eat is grown on site or within amsterdam the four course meal was well thought out and quite tasty the desert was probably the best of the four courses which included soup ok salad ok cheese plate really good and filet of sole pretty goodde kas has a nice garden and serves one daily menu based on homegrown organic vegetables prices are high and some ingredients and portion sizes don t reflect these up marked prices in june july august lovely blue agapanthus flowering plants collection closed sunday but garden is publici ve eaten here three times and each time the food was wonderful it s a fairly expensive restaurant however so it s only really worth it for people who love fresh top flight cuisine one set of friends from the us that i brought here did not and that wasn t the best match other friends who really enjoy food have loved it as much as my wife and i have the staff does a nice job with the wine pairings so that s also recommendedthere were   of us and we enjoyed the outdoor patio in the early evening in the gardens i loved the beautiful dining space with fascinating glass lamps cool to have a greenhouse garden adjacent to dining hall menu is fixed and courses were introduced as they are served food was alright not outstanding lamb was a tad overcooked pricing was fair bill was expensive only because some in our group had many drinks however it was a lovely evening in allprobably one of the best restaurant i have been in my life delicious starters great meals perfect wines fabulous dessertswe dined at de kas for both lunch and dinner during our   day visit to amsterdam excellent restaurant from the first course to the last everything was exquisite fresh and flavorful as can be very nice very reasonable wine list we chose our own wine pairings and were very pleased with the by the glass offerings the dining areas and the surrounding gardens were beautiful if we are ever back in amsterdam we will certainly be dining again at de kasany time we travel we try and pick a special place to have a dinner de kas was where we decided to go first the atmosphere is stellar because you are in a greenhouse and it feels like you are in a park you don t see the city and it feels like a little oasis of peace and countryside the wait staff was attentive but not overly so i thought eating here was an adventure because there isn t a menu the dishes change daily depending on what is fresh they grow a number of the fresh veggies and fruits in the green house on premises and have a farm outside of the city there was a great starter of four different dishes one featured beets another spring chicken and root vegetables amazing fresh mozzarella and greens side note the fresh sourdough baguette with basil oil is awesome the main course was sea bass when a delicious mushroom sauce and fresh vegetables the dessert was a pairfait with giant sweet cherries vanilla mouse and chocolate sour cherry sorbet i would definitely go back and i recommend this if you are looking for something fresh and uniqueme and my girlfriend celebrated five years together and chose this restaurant for the occasion we both loved the food and the atmosphere it felt really fresh and the meals were innovatively composedevery bite and every morsel was fresh and flavourful and each dish was beautifully presented my daughter and i went for lunch we began with the three starter dishes the roasted eggplant puree was fantastic proceeded to the main course a tender and juicy lighter seared piece of haddock and capped off the meal with the most luscious dessert of fresh berries vanilla cream chocolate bits and homemade ice cream divine in fact i m still dreaming about that dessert and would return just for that alone despite the small portion sizes main was decent sized we left satiated and had a very small dinner seven hours later as the meal continued to satisfy a visit to the greenhouse is a must lovely to see all the fresh fruits herbs and veggies growing on site food here is pricey for lunch for two people including two glasses of wine one sparkling water two set menus two desserts and tip was   euros perhaps that s not so expensive for some but it was certainly an indulgence for us bon apetitmy husband and i enjoyed a fabulous dinner on our first night in amsterdam de kas is a beautiful restaurant that focuses on fresh local produce cooked simply and perfectly we enjoyed the tasting menu with matching wines and thought our dinner was extremely well priced and great value the staff were extremely helpful and went above and beyond to provide a memorable dining experience definitely worth a visit highly recommendlovely food served very slowly in a standout setting worth a trip to see the property alone the menu is pre fix but very well donewe did the chef s table but you would have the same experience in the main dining room this is a true farm to table restaurant you actually see the garden on the side of the restaurant and in the green house we sat having a glass of wine before dinner watching the staff carefully choose the garnishments for that evening s meal simply amazing then the food wow the wine selection is outstanding and the sommelier is extremely knowledgeable you will need to take a tram if you are staying in the city center but it is more than worth the trip the park setting is an amazing locationmy boyfriend and i decided to go to this restaurant for our anniversary we opted for a lunch as it was a little far from our hotel there is a set menu and the main that day was fish as i do not eat fish they managed to change the main for me with no issues we ended up having sweetbread veal tongue and duck breast unfortunately i could not bring myself to eat the sweetbread but the veal tongue and the duck was delicious the duck breast was cooked to perfection and the flavours were wonderful for dessert we had some sort of pumpkin cake which i thought might be a bit strange but it was really yummy the best part about this restaurant was the fact that all the vegetables are grown there in the greenhouse and all of the meat is sourced locally i highly recommend this restaurant even if you are not that most adventurous foodiean original concept in dinning and very successful they use what they have grown in the way of vegetables and the menu is very limited as a result but if there is something you don t like they will sort out something else for you all the food was well cooked tasty good quality service was good for hollandbeautiful setting and amazing presentation the meal was perfect from beginning to end starting from drinks in the waiting area with turnips and olives to dessert farm to table presentation and as a prix fixe   course meal with wine pairing very filling awesome meal for   euros and one of our best on our scandinavian tripthe location is impressive the glass house with etchings is very impressive especially after dark with its jelly fish lights can t say enough about the knowledgeable and attentive staff they made us feel welcome and special and then there is the absolutely wonderful dinner   course fixed with wine pairingsmy husband brought me to this restaurant as a surprise for my  th birthday the first impression was exciting as we walked through the park to get to the restaurant nestled quietly away from the bustling streets in a beautiful setting the restaurant was bright and clean we were promptly welcomed and escorted to our table the service was excellent throughout our dining experience with each server ensuring our bread basket water wine etc were full by the way the bread and all the food was made on the premises and it was the best bread i ever had i couldn t stop putting it down even though i really didn t want to fill up on it i made room for each portion it was amazing we loved the restaurant concept of growing many of their own foods we could tell it made a difference in the quality and taste i also liked how there are no menus it s a pre set meal and all went perfectly it s also worth noting that we brought our two year old daughter with us and the staff were great with her too they brought her over toys to play with not just a book with crayons but actual toys i m sure it was expensive but it was worth itthis is a worthwhile place to dine in amsterdam the ambiance is probably the most attractive part definitely an enjoyable place the food is good especially for the menu price nothing fancy but the portions were appropriate and the taste was great they easily accommodated my wife s specific dietary needs the paired wines for the meal were fine nothing overwhelming but again very appropriate for the price the restaurant is outside of the centrum but it is a short taxi ride and if you enjoy public transport it was very easy to get there with the tram actually we enjoyed the ridethe definition of fresh many of the ingredients are grown on site or produced especially for the restaurant a tasting menu provides a great diversity of tastes the excellent service we had a baby in our party of   and they brought her a toy and an airy setting really highlight the foodthe   course menu is a great way to experience this restaurant the quality is good as all ingredients are fresh the atmosphere is nice and you can come over to celebrate or just have a nice time there tend to be quite a lot of groups and business people which i think make it a little less interesting for couples the size of the portions is quite small and we had been left hungry if we hadn t had the drinks that went with the menu had the cheese platter also on the downside i don t understand why cooks who use fresh good quality ingredients don t use spice i m sure they d argue that then you couldn t taste the actual ingredients but here s the trick to master in my opinionsurprise menu of   courses food   service   we had the portuguese wine service stared well but the staff did not provide new glasses when the second bottle arrived unusual lamb was cooked well appetizers were nice if not somewhat bland the atmosphere is gorgeousthis restaurant is in a beautiful setting near a park with its own produce growing outside the windows they are very proud of the produce even hand you an apple when you leave but really this is not the only restaurant in history to use fresh vegetables or locally sourced meat the recitations of the provenance of every little sprig of parsley can seem a bit precious my least favorite aspect of the restaurant is not being able to have any choice of what you re served you re brought what they feel like serving you it is a little demoralizing to see a whole room full of diners with the same piece of fish food itself was nicely prepared but not astonishing all of our favorite course was the dessert actuallya number of friends recommended de kas for our trip to amsterdam and we had a wonderful lunch on the terrace overlooking their garden on a sunny day the service was friendly the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and the menu was inventive locally sourced and very fresh the food was beautifully presented and this restaurant is a must for any foodies visiting the areain a city that is very limited in it s culinary offerings de kas is a shining beacon the food is fresh and simply but imaginatively prepared so that it maintains it s flavour the atmosphere is also fresh and light the service is friendly and informative if a little serious but i believe that is more a dutch thing than something unique to de kas we were in amsterdam for a week and ate out every night this was the one restaurant that stood out as being a cut above the rest in terms of overall ambience cuisine and service i will be returning to amsterdam with my family next year and will make sure to visit de kas at least twicehighly recommended suggest you book early we enjoyed the degustation menu of homegrown seasonal produce used to prepare the mealthis restaurant tries very hard to source local ingredients they grow the majority if not all of their herbs and vegetables we were introduced to a dutch sparkling riesling from the province of limburg that was delicious i didn t even know that holland had wineries the menu is created with the best ingredients available on that day so dinner is always a surprise they are very good at accommodating food allergies and intolerances the presentation is meticulous the chef and his team use classic techniques to maximize the quality of the ingredients we definitely enjoyed the wine pairing available with our dinner this is a slow dinner not to be rushed the staff is young ambitious and talented granted this restaurant is not for everyone but if you love real food and recognize the value of quality then it is a mustwhat made the meal was the company of my   best friends and the setting of the gardens and greenhouse i wasnt going to spoil our special night but felt i should review the place honestly de kas takes itself very serious and airs on the side of pretension as soon as our bottoms hit the chair and before we d been shown any menu or winelist we were offered a appetizer of sparkling wine at   euros a glass then a very quick confusing explaination of our   starters which were ok but not sure why there were   and what the connection was between them then a very rude waitress offered us more wine when our glasses were all full when we declined she said really main course tiny   new potato half a purple carrot and pork medallion not very special then strawberry soup blob of sorbet speck of yogurt and a few basil leaves again it was just ok so overall totally overpriced we found a great little bar in amsterdam with homemade food great portions fab wine and beer and lovely staff for a quarter of the price so think before you book an occasion is what you make it not what you pay for iti had made a reservation for de kas after reading some nice reviews and decided it will be nice for a birthday dinner when we are back in amsterdam the place was not so easy to find but that was understandable i absolutely loved the atmosphere and the whole layout of the place and the greenhouse effect of the restaurant on top of that staff were extremely nice knowledgable about the food as well as wine pairing and were enthusiastic about explaining the dishes and ingredients used etc it was indeed a nice plus point they also spoke excellent english by the way all in we had an enjoyable meal and was happy did well in making reservations ahead of time and also finding out how to get to the place oh tip u could also ask to sit near the kitchen where you can get up close and personal with the chef i thinkthis is my second trip to de kas and although i couldn t get onto the kitchen table the experience was still one to treasure as before the food was all wonderfully put together from fresh ingredients and always managed to surprise you with non obvious combinations a particular highlight of the night was my son aged   being taken off and dressed in a full chef s outfit and then helping plate up our deserts in the kitchen many thanks to tony william the happiest guy you ll ever meet and the team for making the night so special for usa short but pleasant tram ride from the city centre this is one of the best meals i have had in any restaurant each course was a gastronomic delight the chefs use there own home grown vegetables and fruit whenever possible and if not available local source produce the waiter was very knowledgeable about each course and the wine they aim to please atmosphere was excellent especially when it got dark outside the interior glass lights are stunning i cannot wait to go back to amsterdam to visit de kas be sure to make reservations ahead of time at least a weeki heard a lot about this restaurant but when i went there i was impressed by the location only the food and the service was not good enough for the price we paidde kas may be a little way out of the centre of amsterdam but it is certainly worth a visit it s unique glasshouse style is complemented by unhurried top quality service and organic food from its fixed menu which does have a bit of flexibility for substitution when components of the dishes do not suit individual diners they know what you should want right down to the water which they deliberately serve at room temperature as that is better for you than if it was served chilled it was our most expensive dinner in four days in amsterdam and not quite the best so value lets it downpeople who say the food in amsterdam isn t up to par haven t been to dekas the spectacular setting in a converted greenhouse is a little off the beaten track but is well worth the trip and there s something extra special about walking past the garden to your seat and seeing where a good part of your dinner grows menu is prix fixe and covers all the bases most everything comes with some kind of edible flower and is beautifully presented great for a special night outwith several friends we had a fantastic dinner at the the exclusive chef s table in the kitchen of the kas where dinner is at the mercy of the kitchen brigade since all of us are vegetarians we let the chef surprise us and he and his crew put heart and soul in out of the ordinary food how great it is that there are chef s willing to use their artistic mind and not come up with a regular pastagood food served with a smile if only four persons it possible to book the table in the kitchen and see how the chefs are workingthis is a very nice enough restaurant in a great location all ingredients are home grown or bought from free range organic suppliers in the area it s a high end place great atmosphere great service highly recommended for a classy healthy very tastefull meal for a special occasionwe visited amsterdam in february   and de kas was recommended by a good friend who lived out in amsterdam i called a week before and could not get a table but was put on the waiting list low and behold on out day of travel to amsterdam i got a call to say we could be fitted in for lunch we accepted it is about a   minute taxi drive from the centre of town the de kas concept is fab they only serve local produce available either grown in their conservatory or sourced locally in holland the menu therefore is variable and you chose either   or   courses with dietary requirements taken into account fantastic spacious room gorgeous food and great customer service can t go wrong if you are visiting amsterdam book before hand and enjoybeautiful restaurant but i didn t like the food you don t get to choose what you eat so if you don t like what s for dinner too bad i had lamb for main couse which i don t particularly care for the desert was a lemony thing too acid for a good deserta very late review for one of the best restaurants i ve visited like another contributor i simply didn t know how to describe the visit adequately we ve eaten at de kas a number of times over the years enjoying the dedication to seasonal menus their garden and the greenhouse which all are encouraged to wander through the service is effortless thoughtful but unobtrusive and occasionally astounding after an exceptional birthday meal in   i jokingly requested the same meal next year the chef nodded a note was made and twelve months later for our table only my meal was produced with of course de kas variations all done with the minimum of fuss but with obvious pleasure at my reaction thank you so much everyone tot zienscame here for lunch on my first day here in amsterdam it has it s own greenhouse and nursery and the atmosphere was nice great to be here on a spring day the food was simple fresh and good and they used organic vegetables of which some were grown on siteslightly dubious normally about seasonal set menus especially for children but this was a really lovely experience middle of a peaceful park outside the town centre with modern european style food and an emphasis on fresh vegetables and fruit sitting in a glasshouse on longer bright evenings is a great relaxing time very good service i d recommend the reasonably priced wine pairings especially as you don t know what you re going to eatwe had the two course lunch plus dessert and our whole party was extremely happy with the food we were six four adults two of which were vegan who were catered for excellent and two children whom were also given a lot of freedom to roam the greenhouse and garden all in all this was an excellent lunch prepared with the freshest ingredients cooked perfectly what more can you ask for highly recommendedwe booked de kas online and email for a fiftieth meal with friends and family and we were given a table just off the main dining area there were seven of us we opted for the   course set meal     euros per head drinks extra the food was beautifully presented and enjoyed by all i would recommend this place if you enjoy something a little bit differenti am a vegan and they catered to my lifestyle i really enjoyed all the dishes i had the two course lunch followed by a dessert they bring bread olive oil olives and cauliflower before you place an order i love that all the ingredients are either grown by them or are bought from quality organic farms i would reccomend this place to anyone the food was delcious and the greenhouse you sit in is amazing so in love with this little gem of a find must make a reservation by email thoughi have been putting off doing a review of de kas simply for one reason i don t think i have the words or vocabulary to do this experience justice my daughter and i started planning a trip to europe in the late fall for spring my one piece of the trip was dinner at de kas i had wanted to eat here for years and wanted to make sure i did on this trip the food gods were smiling down on me when i e mailed them and was able to snag the chef s table for one of the nights we were in amsterdam i couldn t wait i read everything i could and was counting the days as luck would have it two weeks prior to our trip my daughter could no longer make the trip with me because of so many non refundable deposits i decided to make the trip alone my one concern was how weird would it be to have the chef s table at de kas alone would i feel strange i really debated about going and finally wrote the restaurant and asked if i should now just dine in the dining room cancel or keep my chef s table reservation they replied back to keep my chef s table reservation it would be fine i was so happy they encouraged me to stay as i wouldn t have wanted to miss this experience for anything i took the tram to frankendael park and walked through the park lovely way to arrive suddenly a greenhouse appeared over the quaint footbridge the first thing i noticed walking in was children playing in the greenhouse with fresh produce growing it was a perfect arrival the host greeted me and quickly introduced me to chef bas wiegel who showed me to a wonderful table off to the side of the kitchen i sat down and from the moment the magic started i also never once felt weird of strange dining alone suddenly i had a whole kitchen and restaurant full of new friends lets start there with the staff did each person make me feel welcome yes i felt like i was no longer in a restaurant but in a friend s home i felt like i was a dinner guest and not a restaurant customer the chefs all stopped by at some point and talked food with me the wine stewardess was simply amazing and not only charmed me but taught me all about new dutch wines my new passion i am now back home and obsessed at going into wine shops in the area on the quest for finding dutch wines the dutch wine industry needs to use her as a spokesperson as she sold me on the product the entire staff was amazing friendly hip cool fun professional knowledgeable keep pulling adjectives out of your hat because all the superlatives would fit the crew at de kas then the food started to arrive i have a food gauge that i compare all meals to on the food scale that scale is the french laundry in napa valley we use to have a weekend home not far from the french laundry and on a few special occasion we would eat there from there i had a nucleolus in which to compare all restaurant meals and gauge who would come closest to the french laundry bulls eye well my bulls eye changed on april  th my new food gauge is de kas because of their own greenhouse and farm things are fresh bas wigel works his menu from what is going on in the ground and in the fields most things are local or from the area or what was in season for example my fish was from norway not local but from a purveyor they use and who is familiar with fresh and in season however all the vegetables were from the immediate area each plate was a work of art decorated with edible flowers my two favorite courses were the scallops adorned with a squash blossom and the fresh spargal white asparagus that was at the peak of freshness in holland however each bite was a bit of heaven wines came with each course and as i mentioned prior i was falling in love with the dutch wines especially the whites which were as good as any german white wine which are more famous these are fellow foodies so with each course we talked where the food came from how it was prepared and discussed why the wine works with this course another observation i made was that this is a sane kitchen i have worked in kitchens i have sat at other chef s tables and i can tell you a lot of kitchens are not calm places there is yelling swearing plates slamming and even a fight or two this was calm the crew worked well together and seemed to take the whole process serious there was no yelling screaming or swearing just calm and the love of the craft after the courses i was given a grand tour of the greenhouse and gardens i saw what was coming up and what was next in season being a part of co op farm in pennsylvania i found this part of the meal very interesting the tour ends in the restaurant with dessert and coffee and of course an after dinner wine when i left i stopped the garden who was enjoying an after work beer to thank them this was indeed a evening magic with great wines amazing food gardens and amazing people i came in alone but i left with a group of new friends who i respect and admire for what they do each and every night at de kaswe were   friends celebrating a friends   years anniversary and we where served a delicious   course dinner with fantastic vines the atmosphere in this greenhouse was nice and the service was impeccable by the staff certainly a place i will revisit next time i go to amsterdamthe dining room is one of the most beautiful we ve ever eaten in with the vaulted glasshouse ceiling and natural light its not over the top beautiful the way some finer michelin starred restaurants are but still breathtaking the food was of a high calibre and very well executed and presented it did all taste quite healthy too which did make it seem less of an indulgence on the whole though a great experienceglorious evening and de kas was a wonderful setting for our anniversary meal we had requested our usual table   and were accompanied there by a friendly member of staff we were warmly greeted by staff who remembered us after a glass of champagne with olives and breads we had   delicious fresh small starters the duck main course was stunning and the dessert to die for a must while in amsterdam we ll be backmy wife and i decided to come here for a dinner the restaurant is approx   minute car ride from downtown the facility is in a park and nice location it also has a nice story no menu chef selection changes weekly depending on what is grown or fresh we did do the wine pairing because we just didn t feel like thinking about it staff is great they called for a taxigorgeous setting great service delicious food and wine nothing to complaint about make reservation in advance otherwise won t get it take pictures of the place and show your friends they ll be jealouswhat a place what an atmosphere what a food as i had booked a trip to amsterdam for easter   i tried to find a nice restaurant where to have a good and tasty time according to comments seen on the internet i decided to test de kas everything from the champagne flute with a nice flower in it to the dinner was just perfect and so fresh personnaly i have never ever eat meals with so many amazing tastes and very well balanced flavours coming from vegetables many restaurant all around the world propose lunch worse and much more expensive so if you have the chance to visit amsterdam do not hesitate to take the trolley to this marvelous restaurant for a journey into your own senses for myself no doubt i will returnthe spectacular space alone is worth your visit i am thrilled that we were able to get a reservation here the only one we made in advance of our trip the food was fresh creative beautifully presented and fun the service was also worth noting as it was excellent it was a memorable evening indeed several weeks after we made our reservation i saw something on the internet called   amazing restaurants in unexpected places worldwide and de kas was right up there at   http com news outdoor journey amazing restaurants unexpected places   pagenothe grounds are beautiful and crossing the pond on a wooden bridge is like a scence from a monet painting it is a set   or   course dinner with very few choices unless you have a food allergy or do not eat meat you have to be served the limited choices offered all produce is grown by them and the setting is a huge high ceiling greenhouse i was someone s guest and made the best of it but it would not be my choice to eat here the salad was delicious with unusual greens and veggies and very good i asked for my sliced duck to be served well done but it wasnm t as well done as i d have liked portions were very small one friend had a wine pairing with each course and found the chosen wines to be a little too sweet needless to say bring moneythis was by far the prettiest place we dined at during our stay in amsterdam and we got there by tram the service was exceptional but the food all a bit dull everything seemed to need seasoning and nothing stood out like the concept behind the restaurant but surely the food has to be more tastyafter having read about this place sometimes ago i finally got a chance to visit recently it is really worth a visit the experience from beginning to the end are memorable from the vision concept to food quality and friendly efficient staff although it is tasting menu but with respect to diet allergies the portion size is just nice with high quality of quality in each dishes and presentation in an unique and relaxing big greenhouse highly recommended to visit and experiencethey only have tasting menus but they will adjust the ingredients to respect allergies and personal preferences there are two pre starters and while the portions aren t over sized they are generous and the bread is delicious so we take the three course smallest meal be sure to have the wine pairings all organic of course excellently chosen to accompany the food amazing setting with one all glass wall beside a local footpath which provided interesting sightsat de kas the best experience short of the chef s table is to all in for   euros you get a   course dinner with wine pairings an amuse bouche and aperitif ours was a lovely italian prosecco set inside the boundaries of frankendael park the glass conservatory makes for a wonderful dining experience i enjoyed our food and friends so much that once again i forgot to take photos but go to their website click around and then make yourself a reservation for lunch or dinner de kas is worth you time and money de kas is highly recommended by meperfect food nice staff alround a very good place to eat the tram goes right to the door and it is ind a hugh greenhouse with a great historyoverall i would recommend de kas but be prepared first the setting is lovely the service was great and the food was generally excellent but you should assume you re eating at friend s house and not a restaurant and just take what you get for example i asked for prosecco but the only option was a sparkling dutch wine fine similar situation with beer you get the beer they serve at the end of the meal i was asked if i wanted an after dinner drink and yup i just got one no choices at all for anything having said that most of the meal was really excellent we had lamb as the main course the dessert was a lemon cream crumbled macaroon farm cheese ice cream concoction that neither i nor my sister ate but which our male companions ate after consuming theirs so guess some people find that combination appealingcelebrated hubby s  th birthday the staff were so attentive and the food excellent we chose the wine accompaniment menu and we were not dissapointed a true gemlocated in a refurbished large greenhouse that is located within a small park on the outskirts of amsterdam and you have to walk about   meters and cross a footbridge to get there so cars can t ride you to the door instead of the   euro cab ride we took from dam square only to find our driver could not find the restaurant consider taking a   tram ride and walk in of course advance reservations are essential de kas serves a more or less preset meal allowing for a couple of possible variations the presentations were first rate although the food was real rather than cute and the portions were adequately sized no one left hungry the staff gladly and graciously accommodated my gluten free wife she said they served the best gluten free bread ever and made other menu variations to meet everyone s dietary needs the restaurant serves as an option we availed ourselves of matching pours of a variety of wines that complement the food and makes adjustments to meet each diner s preferences it was an excellent experience that we d gladly repeatthe walk out from our hotel in de pijp took us through some interesting suburban streets to de kas unlikely location in a city park the edge it put on our appetites was handy this place is truly excellent the seasonality and freshness of the ingredients made for a lovely lunchtime experience no choice no rush just a great set menu that left us satisfied relaxed and happy to tackle the walk homea restaurant in a greenhouse growing and serving vegetables all round sounded pretty cool to me and when i found out that they had a small chef s table in the kitchen i just had to try it i went there with my girlfriend and we had an exceptional evening we were greeted by chef de cusine bas who as a person is as far from gordon ramsay as you can get a low key soft spoken guy who explained a little about the kitchen and the concept before the food started arriving i won t go through all the courses but i do want to mention that all courses was presented by the chef that prepared the dish the main course was actually completed at the table and it was the best lamb i have ever had after the main course bas gave us a tour of the greenhouse and restaurant before the cheese and dessert it was nice to get up and move a little bit before the last delicious bites in short it was a perfect evening with delicious food friendly and attentive staff and a wonderful setting i can only recommend visiting bas and his staff in the kitchen of de kasdon t have any negativeness experience every day fresh products every week different menu the restaurant which will always surprise you excellent choice and experience great chefi had booked a couple of restaurants for our trip to amsterdam which i thought would appeal to the family and especially to my vegetarian wife i had thought that the other one the blue pepper an indonesian restaurant would be ahead in that category but it turned out to be de kas instead though bp was still an enjoyable experience the concept involves the restaurant growing some its own produce on the premises and sourcing locally so it takes its fruit and veg very seriously more to the point it turns out interesting and tasty dishes which is a good thing given its no choice approach for the   of us who are not vegetarians we each received a sharing platter of a portion each of a vegetarian dish dutch mozzerella anyone fish mackerel and meat duck all tastily garnished we enjoyed our delicious main of lamb as much as my wife enjoyed hers of beetroot and fennel we all shared a single portion of the cheese platter before wolfing down our puddings a first taste for me of delicious dutch sparkling riesling set up the whole meal nicely which charming slick service only enhanced it s slightly off the beaten track being in a glasshouse which is its name in dutch in a park but easily accessible by taxi or tram the number   which stopped at the same point as the taxi rank recommendedlovely staff fantastic setting but odd you go there on the   tram stops right outside hogewege pay   for a set meal no choice you get what arrives starters well done in themselves but disastrous together lovely mackerel with really bitter leaves which didn t work at all mozzarella turnip beautiful duck great in itself but with marinaded cold carrot but fantastic lamb as a main course cheese didn t impress lovely setting the staff are marvellous you should go to experience it but just go with it be prepared if some things don t worki ve been to de kas a few times and each time was fantastic the comfortable casual dining room is located within an operational greenhouse in a beautiful park the service is outstanding the food tasty fresh and innovative this is a special placemy wife and i spent   days in amsterdam and went to de kas for lunch on our final day the food is top class and the setting is so different to the normal fare in amsterdam it made for a perfect finish to our stay it is away from the old town but take tram   to hogeweg and there it isyou eat in an old greenhouse and you see the vegetables grow around the corner we had a   course surprise lunch and it was all good fresh local vegetables and especially the fish dishes was suberb special plus to interesting and good wine pairingwonderful concept beautiful fresh seasonal ingredients either grown in the greenhouse gardens or sourced locally light preparation with delicious sauces and dressings excellent wine paring environment is unique a greenhouse it is light airy and stylish delightful place excellent service as well it is a bit out of the way so suspect that is why it is not so highly rated but this place deserves to be in the top   or   in the city it is always full and filled mainly with localswe went to de kas for lunch and were thrilled with the food and with the service it was outstanding it is outside of downtown amsterdam but well worth the taxi or the tram to get there each course was perfect great presentation and truly deliciousthis restaurant serves creative dishes with the overall experience being enhanced by its situation in a large greenhouse or conservatory it is located somewhat off centre requiring either an energetic walk a taxi or public transport for the typical tourist but it is definitely worth the effort on a tuesday evening with the establishment well frequented seemingly largely by locals we were offered a set menu consisting of three starters to be shared between the two of us dishes of grey mullet veal and leeks buffalo mozzarella hazelnuts and a main course of haddock with a number of finely judged accompaniments principally a cannelloni stuffed with jerusalem artichoke the final course was either dessert didn t have and so cannot comment except that the people on the next table seemed to be enjoying theirs or delightful local cheeses served with fine accompaniments all the dishes suggested creativity and a delicacy of flavouring and preparation particularly notable was the finesse with which a fairly ordinary fish like haddock became so memorable the service was friendly and attentive and the whole experience was one of the highlights of our stay in amsterdam needless to say this did come at a cost but the overall experience was well worthwhiledissapointed and overpriced for a restaurant that suppose to be good   starter came with hair in the plate   main dish lamp with some vegetables cold and hard to chew   after my main dish i asked for a coffee which came   minutes later   minutes before we leave   the waiter had no experience on opening a bottle of wine price range of our order over average really hope for them to get better since the concept of the restaurant is really nicei really enjoyed eating here we were very lucky with the weather and although it had been a pretty awful day as we arrived the sun came out and it made our time sitting in the lovely big greenhouse very pleasant the food is interesting and inventive with very nice presentation and new and interesting tastes and textures being incorporated well i love that all the produce is local and the staff are all very friendly and knowledgable i really enjoyed eating here and i would recommend it as it s in a nice less visited part of the city and the whole experience was really very goodwe dined at de kas last saturday the  th march firstly the food was fantastic we went for the all in package which included   courses with matching wines for   per person we felt this was great value i had perviously informed the restaurant that it was a special occasion my husbands  th i was delighted when they said happy birthday to him on arrival gave us a good table and also special birthday dessert the venue is epic however if i m been picky is not very well lit inside it s a too bright and given the amazing space should have more ambience the building is beautifully lit from the outside it s a shame this does not carry though our only real criticism is service all the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable but at times a bit too over familiar and chatty we also had a least   different staff wait on us far to many so there was no continuity after the fish course the service really slowed down we waited far to long between courses the evening started out very smoothly and we were made to feel welcome however as the restaurant became busy the standard slipped i would visit the restaurant again and would recommend it if these minor issues could be rectified then it would be a perfect dining experiencewe went there for my birthday last year amazing service tasty food made out of fresh and quality ingredients it is quite expensive   only for the meal but nice for a special treatone of the most incredibly delicious foods in amsterdam i keep coming back every time i am in town though this is the first time i am writing a review about the kas the first time we were looking for a place to grab a quick lunch and the kas was a sheer delight we were so glad to have found this quaint restaurant tucked in at a corner of the city the food was great and the waitress who attended us had been overtly pleasant she always had a welcoming smile on her face the prices we found were slightly on the higher side though the meal was filling and sufficient i quite understand the slightly higher price range because it comes within the tourist zone good ambience and easy to reach not too many customers were present at that time of the night yet the service was a bit slow we had to wait for a while for the food to arrivethe venue and the setting is worth the visit it s about   min by car from the center of amsterdam it was also exciting to see the greenhouses where the produce is grown but unfortunately overall the food did not meet my expectations having all that vegetables grown in house the main dishes were lacking flavor the soup and the desserts were fine and the wine recommendations were excellent the service was also attentive and friendlyit takes a bit of patience to get a table on a week end but it is worth trying kas means green house and most of their vegetables are actually coming from their own production incredibly tasting and would recommend the house menu   dishes including dutch cheeses desert was a bit too original for some of my colleagues but overall a great experience i will try to returnmy husband and i booked our reservation at de kas for valentine s day we had visited this restaurant during our last trip to amsterdam and found it charming with great foodie food and an enthusiastic and attentive staff it did not disappoint on our second visit while i was a bit worried that the pressure of valentine s day might cause a slight dip in food quality or service the kitchen and wait staff did not let us down first for all the gluten free folks this restaurant understands our needs all of my dishes were prepared glulten free but i did not feel slighted in the least instead the differences in the way my dishes were prepared were slight and i believe might have been even better than my husband s dishes who is not gluten free our waitress rachel even brought me a separate container or oil for my gluten free bread so that my husbands wheat bread would not contaminate mine the meal was beautiful interesting and extremely well paced they listened to our likes and dislikes and made adjustments to their normal three course fixed price meal we had the wine parings which were quite good and fell within what we would have paid for a bottle of wine they did not skimp on the pouring and came back more than once to give us a bit more so that we did not have an empty glass finally when we were leaving the staff gave my husband a bag of cookies baked in the shape of hearts in honor of the day however the hostess remembered that i was gluten free and asked us to wait for just a moment as she returned to the kitchen to bring me some caramels as a special gift you would need to go a long way to find a more congenial and delicious restaurant especially for the gluten freethis is our second visit to the kas clearly it means we had a good memory of the first time but this time was even better we arrive at night in a beautiful day that made the settings absolutely splendid the illuminated greenhouse the stars in the sky the moon fantastic start there is no menu here you eat a set dinner that springs nicely and at an appropriate pace at your table from the amuse bouche to the starters to the main to the cheese the desert and the fantastic wine recommended by the waitress everything was very very nice the service impeccable all the way through and at a very affordable price for the quality of the fresh produce we received the only slight downside the place seems to be much more popular than one year ago when we discovered it it was crowded with large groups especially   large american table behind us that were very very noisy would i recommend this absolutelywould i come back see you next time i m in amsterdami went with a couple of friends on my last night in amsterdam the service wasn t the greatest i had made a reservation for   and they had   in their book for some reason we were made to sit at the bar for about half an hour or more while they got our seating arranged it wasn t that busy when it got to actually eating however the food was delicious one of the most memorable meals i ve had will definitely go back when i m in amsterdam again and will definitely recommend to friendsde kas is wonderful the food is incredible the surroundings are perfect the staff are very knowledgable and make you feel perfectly at home some places of de kas standard can be quite snobby we went for the wine matching which was brilliant can t fault anything really other than i wish it was in manchesterjust became a member of ta and i have to write a review of this awesome place i loved the fact they grow their own veggies you can walk and see it yourself in the attached greenhouse the food was light and tasty friendly service when i go to amsterdam i will definitely come backlocal ingredients only based on the time of the year they grow their own veggies meat and fish are from nearby eco suppliers love that s what you tastei have been here several times now and every time it is a great experience great service the food is excellent a seasonable set menu most vegetables come from the greenhousein which the restaurant is basically located for an exceptional experience try the chef s table in the kitchen with every course another well suitable wine is served also a great place for a food partywe reserved for   people and arrived an hour in advance we were seated immediately really great location and atmosphere friendly and professional staff excellent food and wine   course set menu and wine selections were definitely a success we expected and were ready to pay more for the unique experience and great food but finally the price was very reasonable thanks yo the chef and all the staff definitely recommendingwe sat at the kitchen table and over several hours enjoyed a variety of exciting food with expertly matched wines including some we had not previously encountered the explanations by the chefs and maitre d were informative without being intrusive the knowledge of food and wine displayed by all was a joy and an education locally sourced vegetables drive the menus which are notably low carb with wonderful fish and meat combinations this is refreshing approach would appeal to both vegetarians and carnivores equally it is impossible to single out any one particular dish but only to say that we eat every single morsel the kitchen table is more expensive but worth every penny for anyone with an interest in how food is prepared menus chosen orders taken and distributed and of course how the wine is chosen there was not a hint of gordon ramseyesque behaviour just calm efficiency all around this memorable evening was the food highlight of a delightful   day trip to amsterdam we look forward to our next visiti really enjoyed my meal here the setting is lovely in a greenhouse surrounded by fresh fruit and vegetables the food is well cooked and feels healthy highly recommendedcame here in december for lunch as we couldn t get a last minute dinner reservation the food was beautiful it was a two course set menu lunch the dishes are not listed rather come out as a surprise the actual building is fantastic very pretty we ll renovated and cool staff are also wonderful would highly recommend and book in advancehad a delicious meal here at the weekend it was incredible all the food was so fresh and served with a smile we had been recommended it by a friend and it was definitely worth a visitit has been years since i go to the kas and shame on me i have never written a review every time i m in amsterdam i try to visit them as it is never planned i usually phone the day before hoping they have a table free i must say i am always lucky because every time i went the place was fully booked and they always manage to give me a table what i love about the netherlands is their laid back attitude i mean this is a top restaurant but they are all so genuinely kind not stuffy at all which is quite refreshing some of the staff that recognizes me just come to the table to say hi they really make you feel special as for the food it is a fixed menu one can choose from vegetarian fish or meat the nibbles and bread are delicious the starter is for sharing   little plates of absolutely the most vibrant colors and delightful tastes one forgets how a real tomato tastes like the main course is from the same range beautiful tasty and so fresh desserts are sometimes so beautifully presented it s almost a shame to put your spoon in it they also have a small but perfect wine list uncommon wines as well as the usual suspects herbal teas are as you would expect of an excellent quality as for the check no need to take a mortgage on your house it is very reasonably priced for the quality they serve overall it s not only one of the best restaurants on my list but definitely my favorite excellent food and drinks amazing staff combined in a unique place thank you all at the kas for making each experience unique and memorablecourse set price meal with perfect wine pairings we had venison with lingonberries and smoked mashed potatoes as a main the staff were exceptionally nice and attentivei visited this restaurant during my trip to amsterdam and i must say it was one of the coolest spots i have ever been the food had an idea and tasted great the service was very good and knowledgeable i loved the open space and attached greenhouse through which you can walk and check on their vegetables even though it is a little far from the center it is really worth the tripif you can only reserve one restaurant in amsterdam make it this one de kas situated in an revamped nursery was a destination to see as well as taste we were hesitant to take public transportation so far out of town super clean and fun we were nervous about the single choice for dinner delectable the waiters were fun and the hostess came by several times to make sure everything was perfect our food was fresh hot or cold and tasty the atmosphere was bright clean and sparkly coming from california fresh local food is expected don t forget to take an apple at the door on your way out it was the perfect endingmy wife and i were in amsterdam for   nights and a friend recommended this place its found in an old greenhouse that has been converted to a restaurant it was lovely we took the tram there but on our walk in we couldn t help but be impressed by the modern feel of the place you pass the garden as you walk in alas in november there wasn t much growing but they later told us its usually full the front of house staff were really nice and warmly welcomed us taking our jackets and then walking us through the main atrium to our table it was very nice looking we had the prix fixe menu which included several plates four in total i believe including cheese dessert and the accompanying wine tasters the food was delicious so fresh and local the staff explained everything comes from their local greenhouse when able the price was high but we both agreed it was reflected in the quality and portions of the various plates all in all highly recommendedi ve been here with a couple of business partners tonight and i must say we were pleasantly surprised with the great service i rarely see such attention towards the dining customers most restaurants you really have to initiate contact with the serving personnel but here they were ahead of us each time food was nice and all organic made in their own greenhouse it was nice but not mind blowing i will go here again with my wife just because she loves biological foodthe service was fantastic warm engaging and very knowledgable i loved having no menus and just accepting the wonderful surprises served the food is all based aroundcseasonalmngredins grown in the adjoining green houses i wish this place was closer to home but i d go out of my way to revisit this placetitle says it all great setting but praise stops there took ages to get served food was cold when it arrived and waiters too interested in chatting to and serving adjacent table of single females totally failed to deliver on hype and expectationsthe setting and being able to eat in the greenhouse where most of the produce comes from is really a great concept the service is fantastic wonderful wine pairing and the meal itself was very good definatly worth a tryi wanted to make sure the weekend trip i organised was extra special for my boyfriend s  th birthday after weeks of researching i came across de kas on a number of websites it came highly recommended and even ranked as one of the top   restaurants in amsterdam early booking was advised so after emailing them directly with my reservation enquiry i was pleased to hear from them confirming availability for dinner i explained it was for a birthday and was looking to arrange something special they reassured me that this would be noted and a nice romantic table be set up for us no advance deposit was required just a request to email them the day before to confirm only a short tram ride away from all the busy tourist areas was just perfect for us from the outside it s looks like a lovely old brick building with a very large fancy conservatory green house on the side of it inside it s beautifully decorated atmosphere is warm welcoming not overly noisy nor cramped the staff are so accommodating they explain the menu thoroughly consisting of   starters to share a main course each then a dessert each all for approx   euros the waiter staff also recommend the wine pairing to accompany the meal and i would highly recommend you do this and at only approx   euro you get around   glasses each we loved the fact that you didn t feel rushed in between courses and the food well it was just fantastic when the dessert arrived the chef had decorated my boyfriends plate very sophisticatedly with happy  th birthday what an enjoyable memorable birthday he had thank you de kas p s it s certainly not the cheapest place but you definitely get what you pay forthe restaurant is set in the park and even walking into it is a lovely experience we went in the evening and it was quite magical to see the setting is beautiful the service is very good everyone was attentive but not overbearing the food is taken from their own gardens and if they don t have it they source it locally the meal was very interesting with a variety of vegetables not usually found such as purple potatoes and yellow carrots very tasty i particularly enjoyed the beetroot i think it is slightly overpriced compared to some other meals i have had in amsterdam but the setting is unique so i suppose that is what you are paying for but it is worth a visit especially for a special occasioni was lucky enough to eat at the chef s table last week and thoroughly enjoyed the evening after meeting tommy the head chef each chef came to the table introduced themselves and then explained what they had prepared for us we had multiple small courses each also accompanied by a selection of wines each poured and described in detail the food is grown in their own gardens and greenhouses and the chef takes what he has fresh and then decides what to put with it fish fowl etc we enjoyed and very nice clear mushroom soup served to the table in transparent tea pots fresh salmon smoked on the premises very slow roasted meats and with them all a selection of uncommon vegetables the purple potatoes stand out in my mind between the main meal and dessert we had a tour around the restaurant and then enjoyed a selection of cheeses one of which a buffalo cheese was made by the waitress s parents and finally a very nice poached pear accompanied by ice cream i should mention the washer up he was a star and very entertaining also martin lovely guyeasily one of the best places i ve been to the setting is so unique and charming they could have served card board and i would have loved it but the food is also great i love their menu they have a lunch or dinner item that s it it s fresh in season ingredients mostly from their own garden made into a dish created by the chef for that day the food couldn t be more perfect the restaurant is set on a the grounds of a park inside a green house great light in the dining room it s all glass and great decor very nicely done their approach to service is also pleasantly relaxed very un american not inattentive just relaxed they were running around but didn t make us feel like things were rushed we sat there for     hours for lunch they spaced out drinks appetizers and entrees so perfectly that it didn t really feel like     hours i would generally be annoyed if my lunch took that long but they made it feel right and they were in no rush to get us out we could have easily sat there for another half hour without anyone bothering us overall i d highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner in amsterdam it s a little pricey but well worth the moneyate at the kitchen table last thursday food and service were incredible chef tommy was great at explaining each dish and sommelier fabiane very knowledgable one of the best dining experiences we have ever had highly recommend you pay a little extra to eat in the kitchen this is a great placefor wealthy cuisine lovers for wealthy cuisine lovers no food a la carte fixed menu with no choice full surprisestaff very friendly and helpful wine pairings very good not sure i would have chosen veal cheek but it was very tasty after dinner the chef showed how the dish was prepared very open kitchen nice experiencethe food was very tasty maybe   grams more per serving would suit our needs perfectly great wines especially their home made sparkling wine you have to taste it very bioour experience at de kas was simply wonderful from the greeting at the door to the service and send off the staff was extremely kind and professional the ambience is so serene uplifting and warm the daylight floods into the restaurant that is situated in a greenhouse with a little pond all you see is green the food was delicious we ventured in de kas with two kids for lunch with reservation of course kind of concerned that the kids may not like the food but it was really very good the starters as well as the main dish the check was also very reasonable overall we walked out fully satisfied they even sent us off with organic apples as giftsfrom the atmosphere to the way they treated me this was a singularly incredible experience i took the tram by myself from dam square and when i arrived i walked across a fairy tale bridge to what seemed like an oasis in the night what greeted me was a warm and friendly staff a one of a kind dining room huge greenhouse feel with hipness to spare the most beautifully fresh menu most of which seemed grown on site all parts of my meal were paired with exquisite wines and every step was explained perfectly looked after impeccably when i passed on the final coffee after cheese course and dessert course my great server hasan bagged up chocolate almonds nougat for me to take home and then he gave me a tour of the entire grounds which have to be seen to be believed too to bottom amazing if you eat one place when you come visit amsterdam it has to bede kas ps best gluten free bread everreally enjoyed dining at the chef s table the whole family enjoyed the theatre of the kitchen and loved the food too would recommend this as it was the best seat in the housevery different in many ways the resturant is a   plus feet set back from the street so at night you feel very removed from the neighborhood the greenhouse glass ceiling and lighting are warming food is seasonal and exceptionally fresh once you state items you won t eat such as pork or nuts your choices are done each course was exceptional and flavors were well tuned to each other the servers work well as a team and the tables are spaced for maximum comfort would absolutely will go backthere are two things special about this place de kas which means the greenhouse in dutch   it is in a greenhouse where in certain parts all kinds of vegetables are still grown this gives a very specific and nice ambiance  almost all food is grown by themselves or by local sustainable and organic producersthe preparation of the food and the wines are of a high quality and the service is fine and very very friendly as well only drawback is the price   euro a person is easily spent for a dinerde kas is a very special restaurant it is set inside a massive greenhouse that once grew vegetables for the town part of the space is still used fro growing and you can walk through this fragrant garden the greenhouse itself is set in a beautiful park it is a truly magical setting if you arrive before sunset you should stroll through the park first and then once you are seated in the restaurant watch the sky change from blue to pink to violet through the glass walls and ceiling once the sun has set the glass walls reflect the glow of candles on the tables making it very romantic there is an open kitchen so you can see the creative chefs at work there is always a tasting menu using local produce from their own farm and green house and carefully sourced ingredients the night we dined there it was a special vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings for each course available the cooking was creative delicate and unique de kas is a bit of a splurge but well worth it to experience this lovely space and fine cuisinei chose this restaurant to be the star of our short trip to amsterdam given that my wife is a vegetarian i wanted her to have food that was thoughtfully prepared and cooked specifically for vegetarians all the reviews and guide books indicated that this was a restaurant for foodies and we were both looking forward to it we caught the no   tram which dropped you right outside the park had a drink in the bar over the road because we were early and made our way to the restaurant it is a stunning restaurant very stylish and you immediately feel at home the staff are young attentive very enthusiastic very knowledgable and you could not wish for better service we had wines as recommended for the courses which were terrific value and very good somehow and my wife said it first that the only thing we did not rave about was the food it was well cooked and there was nothing wrong but that was the point neither did it have the wow factor either in taste or presentation given that this is not a cheap restaurant we somehow just expected more and were willing for there to be a course that we could rave about it didn t happen which is a real shame given that the restaurant has everything going for it the food simply didn t have the wow factor that is not to say that we didn t have an enjoyable dining experience because we did but for once in a top end restaurant the food was not at the top of the list of reasons to be cheerful sorrythe greenhouse is a must see in amsterdam we didn t dine excessively well during the three weeks we spent in europe so this was a treat the restaurant is in an heritage greenhouse in a nice spot of greenery outside central amsterdam we caught tram   from the centraal station not complicated the set menu is more of a gastronomic degustation varying depending on the produce which is local or grown by the restaurant itself we were olives and bread too start then had three light but flavoursome starters a small main i had the vegetarian tarte tatin with beetroot everyone else had fish with plentiful vegetables and a lovely dessert the verbena ice cream was particularly memorable although a cheese board was available too thoroughly enjoyable and worth every cent great service perfect location for a wedding it was very light inside and we couldn t even tell it was overcast and raining outsidehad two course lunch at this beautiful greenhouse restaurant de kas has its own greenhouses and garden near the restaurant where they grow mediterranean vegetables herbs and edible flowers and served it to the table in love with this place and the staffs are professional yet attentive and friendlyi had lunch with a friend a month ago we walked there from the the docks long long walk we took a tramway on the way back to the city centre   min the place is beautiful lots of light coming through the greenery amsterdam s light you won t get roasted as we arrived to the restaurant we walked through the vegetable garden which is beautiful obviously enough at least for anyone who has experience of vegetable growing their own supply cannot cover the demand of such a restaurant but it s good they use their herbs and what they can anyway the service is nice and attentive without being fussy and i appreciated it very much the food i remember i had some fish with vegetables some pumpkin maybe i remember very well that i was pleased with my lunch and had a very nice time but i can t remember what i actually ate so i would say the food is fresh and good but not memorable if in amsterdam again i would go back because my experience was very pleasant overall and the place is worth a visitfriends had told me about da kas when i googled it and found the web site i was fairly certain i was in love with these people and their concept for food flavours and hospitality the concept was includes a three course tasting menu fixed which can often be problematic for the girl with allergies i emailed to see if they could work around my allergies the immediately responded letting me know that it wouldn t be a problem a lovely man named enno arrived to ask if we might enjoy an apero of champagne a sparkling riesling from the netherlands a riesling but then technically it s not champagne he concurred and let us know it was dry not sweet so we agreed to try it who knew riesling could be so good they offered us delicious olives roasted celeriac a house made basil oil with sourdough rolls and what was in that four little bowl with our apero i asked enno if we might talk about my allergies to which he replied yes the kitchen is fully aware of your you are allergic to all fish nuts mushrooms melon bananas and the gloves made of latex i think my jaw dropped open and my friend replied that s incredible chef tommy this great english guy came to our table with our starters and began with we really appreciate it when guests let us know about their dietary concerns so thank you wow when does that ever happen usually i feel like i ve inconvenienced the kitchen or comprimised the chef s creativity or worse they ignore me and think i m just being picky my love for da kas is swelling we both started with soup of this tiny rare potato kate has the name written down with fennel flowers greens mustard and dried toasted onion tommy told us how to make the toasted onion and i can t wait to try it enno paired the soup and my second starter with a lovely bio white from the region the soup was incredible and the wine pairing perfect our second starter began with a beet root roasted tomatoes and prosciutto for me and kate s had beets and melon in hers both were topped with a beet root puree which was delicious and went well with the bio white enno had recommended i looked at tommy unsure about the third starter since i wasn t a fan of eggs and i never ate anything fried he told me he could make me something different but assured me that the egg was fired in sunflower oil and there was no possible cross contamination i decided i was willing to give it a go the egg was incredible it tasted like fluffy goodness with roasted carrots and turnips enno had paired this starter with a rose of mostly malbec grapes so a little darker in color kate s third course was a white fish forget what that was apparently delicious and paired well with the second white she received red arrived for our main course tommy came out to share we would be having porc on a bed of roasted sweet potatoes and fennel toasted pumpkin seeds more greens and flowers and an incredible drizzle porc ranks bottom on the list of meats i would prefer to eat i d pick nearly any other gamey fowl friends lapin canard or agneau above porc but again i was willing to give this a go the delicious piece of perfectly cooked saignante piece of meat in front of me neither looked liked or tasted like the other white meat i ve had in the uk or france it was tender and delicious tommy came out to check on us at some point and i asked how long he had been at da kas well like you i came here for dinner two years ago with my brother who was living in amsterdam and i was so impressed i interrupted you decided to go to culinary school he laughed no but i went back to his apartment printed out my cv and came back the next day they hired me on the spot and to tell you kitchens can be well difficult places to work here everyone is great like family and i m given the opportunity to experiment and have fun doing what i love when i asked what tommy might like to do in the future he told me he was quite happy but some day i might like to go back to england to be close to family and to start something like this where the food is inspired by what is fresh and prepared from the land we re fortunate right now over   of the ingredients are from our farms and greenhouses come winter it s more difficult to have such variety we decided that while we were fully satisfied we had room for the third course of dessert the dutch know how to pace a meal we were presented a lovely lemon tart with house made meringue vanilla and berries my love for da kas is about to grow exponentially in between enno and tommy tending to our care several other delightful staffers delivered engaged and provided treats to our table we were also given a bowl of caramelized white chocolate and cookies with our espresso enno ordered us a taxi and we prepared to depart giving tommy and the kitchen staff our regards and deep appreciation as enno walked us to the door he offered us apples from a giant bowl we d passed on the way in this was hands down the best dining experience ever it was not fussy over done over priced or over the top it was perfect from the first email exchange to our send off some three hours later lovei found this restaurant googling gluten free eating what a lovely place you eat at the greenhouse where many ingredients you eat are grown the meal starts with apps and drinks in the gardens and follows with a meal in the greenhouse which is soooo airy everything is so fresh and they rose to my challenge of a few food allergy issuesmy best friend had her wedding here and it was fantastic how can you not like dining in a gorgeous greenhouse where beautiful food is growing everywhere i still remember how incredible the cucumbers tasted   years later i highly recommend this place for a wedding it gave me a lasting impressing of amsterdammy husband and i had lunch at de kas to celebrate his birthday the experience was unique and the greenhouse effect was nice while the food was nothing too fancy memorable it was not bad the service was great and location garden interesting definitely worth a visit for the experiencethe theory is compelling grow your own organic veggies and try to stay with locally sourced foods we thought that for the most part the meals here were overpriced and lacking in taste clearly others feel differently but for my taste stick with elsa s cafe across the street at the tram stop it s fun to take a tour of the greenhouse while you wait for your table the location in a public park is sorta rural and the enormous greenhouse where much of the produce is grown is an easy to find landmark take the   tram from centraal stationfresh organic food grown on the premises the set menu is based on what they can get fresh that day and the wine matches were superb up there with any dining experience i ve had in the world the decor was amazing too like eating in a greenhouse and the service and staff were excellentbeautiful conservatory grow their own food or source it locally three course prix fix dinner they serve whatever is in season and avaiable it is a special occasion restaurant that ius a foodie s paradisea prix fixe dinner a little pricy but the service was excellent food prepared well and presented well get there early ask to see the garden hot house and the outdoor garden where the veggies are grown also grown out of town ask why the brick chimney is still attached to the hot house style buildingwe arrived early for our reservation so we were able to sit outside in the garden and enjoy the gorgeous garden park setting with aperitifs it is so peaceful and serine we had dinner in the dining room and they did not disappoint it is a fine dining experience and the food was wonderful i would compare it to california cuisine made us feel like we were home this would be a great romantic spot but also perfect for a group of friends make sure you get a tour of the green housearguably one of the classiest restaurants in amsterdam service is stellar not only when compared to typical dutch service but also what you expect when you enter a restaurant you would qualify as classy the food is excellent with a menu that changes regularly the restauranteurs grow their own produce the restaurant also serves beers from the local brewery de prael the wine selection is excellent with recommendations based on the meat being served highly recommend the place for celebrations and corporate dinnersi like most had been anticipating a great experience i walked an hour and a half to get there mostly for the exercise thinking i was going to stuff myself one would expect mostly vegetables or at least a lot of them but they were really stingy with everything and iceberg lettuce for salad come on the main course was fish that was just full of bones and really nothing special to the entire meal the best part were the tomato plants in the greenhouse which we only got   small dried pieces of in the salad but the plants were really amazing i should have just skipped the meal i won t be backyou will be sitting in a big green house and lit up olive trees the atmosphere is great and staff very friendly most of the vegetables will be from the the green house or garden around you and guaranteed fresh the set menu offers you different choices if you got allergies or dislikes this is one of the few places where the main course duck is as tasty as the starters the wine selection is good or if you prefer beer they got lots of good ones from a local brewery highly recommend for celebrations or special occasions a tray of plums for the road will provide sweet memories until next timeclean modern restrained food great service amazing greenhouse dining room and unique concept quite simply the best in amsterdam gode kas is what its name indicates a working greenhouse cum organic restaurant beautiful lyrical setting slightly outside the centre of town most of the non protein food served are sourced right there in the adjoining garden and greenhouse or from a nearby farm owned by the founder there is no menu or rather you don t know what s being served until the day of the meal the restaurant operates on a fixed price which is quite reasonable given quality the cooking really tries to make the vegetables herbs fruits shine and they do so fragrant sweet with unusual textures the flavour comes from the incredible freshness of the produce rather than from seasonings or complex cooking techniques so amateurs of hearty cajun rib eye steak bbq pork ribs or lamb vindaloo like myself might find the food a bit bland however if you eat slowly to savour the food you will discover the earth s bounty i was very pleasantly surprised and impressed unusual wine list with among others a light and surprisingly good dutch red wine friendly and helpful servicefor you real foodies out there and you know whom you are you ll be happy with this mostly because it s reasonable especially for europe and with the usd eur rates however the food is just ok it s worth experiencing hint take the   tram don t waste your money on the ridiculous ams cabbies the tram drops you off right in front and will pick you upwe had a glass of dutch bubbly on the terrace over looking the vegetable and herb garden before dinner and completely forgot that we were in a city it was lovely the food was fresh and light and the staff were attentive recommend this place very highly for a lovely eveningde kas is what its name indicates a working greenhouse cum organic restaurant beautiful lyrical setting slightly outside the centre of town most of the non protein food

in a park surrounded by their own greenhouses and flower gardens the staff were very attentive and friendly we were shown the fixed price menu and the wine list however we chose to go with a wine recommendation per course as it was our last day in amsterdam the food was served like a tasting menu with the waiters explaining where each of the ingredients came from the wine was served with the same explanation we opted for the additional cheese course as well and this was great too i found the whole experience was really good and recommend this place even though its someway out of amsterdam by tram unless you are staying the the manor hoteli booked on line and my emails were answered personally always a good start we arrived early and were made welcome we looked around the garden examined everything marvelled at the nesting storks and parrots we were made very welcome by the team everything was made easy for us the food was very good very interesting there is plenty of space so we did not feel crushed the whole evening was lovely the place is delightful were that there were more such restaurants do go take the tram its very easywe went for my  th birthday for lunch and had the   course lunch at     euros it is not really   courses we got   things as a starter absolutely stunning food the staff were attentive but not overly so and all spoke great english and made us feel so welcome next time i go to amsterdam i want to go for the evening chef s table in this stunning restaurant definitely go for a special occasion they will make it even more special for you we even got a free personalised dessert for my birthdaybrought family from canada there who are real foodies gourmets and we sat at the chef s table everyone was so kind playful and above all professional loved watching the people in the kitchen real pros and real harmonious creating they mentioned something about   courses at the onset but it felt like food kept coming all night every bite is a thoughtful creation of amazing sensations if you don t sit at the chef s table still ask for their recommendations for a wine to accompany each course they really know how to beautifully combine the bubbly with the gastronomy we had an absolutely magical evening with a huge thank you to everyone at de kaswe booked the kitchen table which was just amazing the food was perfectly prepared and the entire staff was just fantastic to talk to hope you like your veggies because there are a lot of them well generally a lot of food and drink and some amazing wines for surea wonderful restaurant the produce is outstanding and was used in every course to very good effect the service was friendly and attentive the family of storks nesting in the chimney to the greenhouse added to the serene country atmosphere i highly recommend de kas note that becaus of the limited menu this would not be a good place for young childrenwe went here for a meal late lunch with our studio when visiting amsterdam for a few days it was amazing the setting is fabulous and very original although off the beaten track from central amsterdam they seated around   of us in one room greenhouse and talked us through all the food we were eating the sharing type food was perfect for us and something which is growing in popularity in london the quality of food service ad environment was excellentthe restaurant is located in a park with a lovely garden in front of it you are seated in a large green house looking local with a high ceiling and a modern interior the service is excellent warm and friendly the food is fresh simple and focused de kas serves a fixed menu choice of meat or vegetarian one of the most charming things with the restaurant is that they pick edible flowers from the garden and in season vegetables and fruit from their greenhouse they do have a larger green house on a farm outside of amsterdam where they get most of their food supplies from a great place for ending a busy day on the town i would have expected it to be a bit more formal but it was quite a relaxing atmosphere which was very niceone of amsterdam s very best places to treat yourself to an outstanding meal delicious food served with grace and sensitivity go with your tastebuds switched on to savor all of the texture combinationsi didn t love the food it was all sort of bland the venue which is in a greenhouse in the middle of a park is stunning the servers are friendly knowledgeable good looking and helpful yet the salad containing the freshest possible ingredients was rather boring and the main course that night which was a veal ribeye with a rubesco sauce needed seasoning you will feel really good about yourself for eating here it has all the buzzwords local sustainable organic but for me it had lots of zippedy but no doodahthe setting in a flower laden garden felt like we d stepped into a dutch version of renoir s film sunday afternoon in the country nearby storks were tending their hatchlings on a roof top four of us had the prix fixe lunch there was a tomato eggplant mixed bean and herb salad a veal pastrami salad with wonderfully prepared sweetbreads on zuchinni ribons sweet bay shrimp soup grilled hake on dutch fingerling potatoes with capers a paper thin slice of rose queen turnip and a grilled fennel bulb two wines came with the lunch for a   euro supplemnt we also ordered coffee and dessert a homemade black cherry chocolate ice cream served with chocolate sponge cake and fresh currants and bing cherries service was attentive friendly and very acommodating we arrived when de kas opened and stayed the afternoon because the setting was so enchanting and relaxing staff never hurried us we would highly recommend de kas to people who like good fresh organic and well sourced food served in a garden setting we took the number   tram from downtown spuy to the hogeweg stop walked across a bridge over a pond full of blooming waterlillies to reach the restaurant a great amsterdam afternoon outdoorsi read about de kas and made a reservation based on a magazine article an article or a review cannot even capture this restaurant we had a booking for a party of six but then wrote to expand our group and were asked if we would like to have the business table which was a wonderful move upon arrival we were dropped off at a bridge into a park we had a lovely walk over the bridge where local families were just hanging out a local baker was putting loaves of bread out for ducks and the whole relaxed and lovely scene began our evening upon entering de kas we were invited out to the terrace to tour the beautiful herb and flower garden to have a drink before dinner our server jarl was charming from the start and gave a tour where we could taste a few plants and learn more about how the restaurant began and the way that de kas continues to operate this gave us time to take in the unique setting he set the whole tone for the evening by saying we should relax and come to the table whenever we were ready the menu is based on what is fresh and interests the chef jarl asked if we had allergies or dislikes that they should work around after taking stock the chef began to create and we enjoyed being served surprise dishes our starters came out three choices to taste all were excellent fresh organic and filled with flavor our main course was fresh fish and a melange of vegetables cooked to perfection the freshness and flavor of the food was unparalleled in any other setting or restaurant the service was welcoming and responsive jarl gave us local tips for our visit to nederlands we are now back home and one of the party was talking with me and mentioned that de kas was the high point of the tripwe had lunch here on a very hot day and sat on the terrace next to their extensive herb and vegetable garden a set meal awaits dinners and on the day we visited that meant broad bean and pea risotto hake watermelon ice cream but that doesn t give any idea of this amazing food presented lovingly plates dressed with edible flowers fresh seasonal vegetables and fine sauces created by expert chefs you ll need to save a few pence our   course lunch for   came to   euros worth every pennywe went here for lunch it was a bit of a way out of the centre but worth the bike ride it is a really unusual place looks like a garden and a collection of small greenhouses quite expensive but worth a visit if you enjoy excellent foodexcellent tasty and healthy food in a marvelous setting with helpful and knowledgeable staff unforgettablesitting at a table next to the design team at experimentaljetset after a day of design experiences topped off by dinner in a large period green house a must twicethis was our second visit to de kas we went two years ago on a previous visit to amsterdam we love this restaurant not only is it light and spacious it is located in a greenhouse but the food is delicious as well as being healthy much of the food is grown on the premises and we had a look round the greenhouse where the fruit and vegetables are grown before our meal the courses are delicate and exquisite but substantial enough too the service is impeccable and the wine list good one of our favourite restaurants in the worldthroughout a meal in the atmospheric de kas one suspects that the staff tries to make your meal memorable to a degree they succeed located in a prime location de kas is a good restaurant for a special occasion full of ambiance the concept seems set on a creating a place with a lot of light we went in summer and a more then usual amount of waiters for a typical dutch restaurant de kas tries too much to be nice in my opinion and the service tends to be stiff it offers interesting dishes especially the entrees with some of the best mozzarella cheese i have ever tasted having grown most of its produce the flavors are interesting but not definite one can eat better vegetables in other places the dishes with violets and other flowers are good and correct the asparagus we were offered from venlo were excellent maybe the best of the meal are the wines which really combine well with the veal and other dishes eating in the de kas is an interesting experience and advancement in dutch cuisine one word of advice is to try different wines with the starters the main course and the dessertsis this place worth the walk from the center of amsterdam absolutely it takes about   mins to get there but it s a really nice walk past some universities and parks and the restaurant is in another park itself we have learnt de kas means greenhouse and that s exactly what this place is a greenhouse that serves food using the vegetables grown in the greenhouse a tour of the greenhouse is encouraged how more local can you get however this would all be a gimmick if the food was not any good but it is we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch menu the vegetables were fresh obviously and very well prepared and the meat was great too from local farmers we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal in amsterdamde kas is situated in a lovely park and is surrounded by beautiful gardens the chef selects the menu for the day based on what is available in their own gardens there is no printed menu but the server will take into account any dietary preferences a delicious meal served by attentive staff i suggest you begin your evening with a drink on the terrace and enjoy the viewwe had lunch here on a weekday not cheap but it s worth every penny the place looks great the dining area is in the middle of a greenhouse adjacent to it there is an actual greenhouse where many of the fruits and vegetables tomatoes cucumbers melons actually used in the dishes are grown whatever is not grown on site is sourced locally from small farmers there is a fixed menu based on whatever is available seasonally we got first a bowl of large olives pickled cucumbers and delicious bread while we waited then   small dishes as appetizers and finally a main course fish but it was possible to exchange it for veal everything was delicious the service was very prompt and courteous it would be very interesting to see it in the dark as well the atmosphere must be very different will have to visit again in winter timegreat food great staff and an excellent location we ate on three separate occasions and were treated with enthusiasm kindness and servicesix of us went here on wednesday  th june to celebrate my wife s  th birthday the evening experience far exceeded any expectations that we may have had from our initial arrival up to our departure we were made to feel special by all staff our waiter hassan looked after us throughout the meal explaining each dish and each wine that accompanied each course we chose the wine pairing highly recommended it was explained to us that they grow their own produce some on site some in a larger greenhouse off site meat and fish is also sourced locally the set menu is changed weekly dependant upon produce available please do not be put off by a set menu as this did give us an opportunity to try dishes that you may not otherwise choose all six of us enjoyed every single dish that was put in front of us both the presentation and quality of the dishes was amazing the enthusiasm demonstrated by staff included an opportunity for us to be shown around the on site greenhouse and other areas of the restaurant including the kitchen by one of the chefs this proved to be both interesting and informative in relation to it s history the restaurant is built inside a beautifully restored municipal greenhouse incorporating one large dining area with a number of smaller dining areas attached although this may sound strange it does look amazing the atmosphere is very relaxed and you are not rushed at any point during your visit we were there for five and a half hours you can reach the restaurant quite easily by tram number   from the central station stops right outside or by taxi for all of us the visit turned out to be very special and has left us with a fantastic memory of my wife s birthday that will stay with us for a very long time thank you to everyone at de kasa surprise visit with friends for a  th birthday celebration we were amazed to see we were eating in giant greenhouses with vegetable and flower gardens surrounding it the restaurant change their menu weekly and use all the produce they grow both on site and in a nearby village all other fish and meat etc is sourced locally the menu is fixed as is the price and you can also choose to have your wine chosen by the restaurant for each course which is what we did   starters main meal a choice of cheese platter if required and a sweet there were   of us each with different likes and dislikes yet we all cleared our plates on every course food was fresh different and incredibly tasty with the chosen wines complimenting the food we were given a tour of the greenhouses a tour of the kitchens and every course was explained to us with its ingredients for us it was an amazing experience with all the staff being so committed to and proud of the restaurant and its ideals a meal and experience none of us will ever forget a must do for anyone visiting amsterdamfrankedael park starts at hogewort fairly far out the   tram line walk a bit further along its street to the entrance to the park and this restaurant that grows its own veggies on site and supplements them with deliciously prepared meats and fish we were there for a celebration so did not see a menu but i will certainly celebrate what we were served for freshness variety and taste reservations requiredthis restaurant has a daily changing fixed menu there are no choices although they will easily accomodate your preferences like vegetarian or no fish what is really nice are the veggies they are very original and tasty and fresh the quality of all the food is very good good wine selection also by the glass the environment of a greenhouse in a park is really nice the starter consisted of   fantastic little plates which were served all at the same time this was a bit of a pity since they were not so hot anymore by the time we got to the last of the three starters on top these starters are a full dish in itself my wife decided to skip the main course after this service is personal and professional good choice if you are visiting amsterdam it is also a bit of away from the beaten path in a nice part of amsterdamgorgeous greenhouse surrounded by a park was a perfect place for our last dinner in amsterdam the menu is a prix fixe and they can accommodate requests i don t eat red meat without an issue the food was really excellent and the service was great would definitely recommend this to anyone in amsterdamthe setting of this restaurant in the park is lovely the restaurant has a lot of glass and its own greenhouse where they grow many of the veggies the menu is a   course setmenu you don t order your choice all the dishes were fresh unique and deliciousit is quite a taxi ride to get here but worth it for the experience the produce is grown on the grounds and all the ingredients as local as possible it is a set menu with no choice so you must be adventurous to dine here it is about   euros per with a   euro wine pairing which was worth it as we arrived a local family was arriving there on bikes to dine there were many bikes parked outside a good sign i think the service was cordial and good after one mishapa great meal beautifully presented well proportioned and delicious we will visit every year with pleasurethis restaurant is what i d call pretentious the dining room is enormous terrible acoustics the tables are placed such that you sit nearer the person at the table next to you than the person with whom you re eating all this detracts from the food which i m sure was delicious although i can t remember it outrageously expensive it s the sort of place tv celebs go toarrived in ams on a saturday afternoon and was able to book the kitchen table two days later beautiful setting and the service was incredible friendly each new staff member who delivered something to our table introduced themselves and shook our hands that wouldn t happen in the states all beverages were included in the cost and they were very generous with the wine and bottled premium water the restaurant was fairly empty when we sat just before seven but was full a short time later it was fun watching the kitchen rev up and push plates out one of our dishes was a garden platter literally edible flowers and just picked vegetables so different and interesting food was very good simple presentations very dutch after out mains were served we were taken on a tour by one of the chefs that was fun and we got to sample a few more deceivingly edible plants if you can try the leaves of an oyster plant do it after   hours there we closed down the restaurant and could not even finish the dessert wine pairings we were so satiated plus we had to ride bikes back to our apartmentdefinitely a meal i will never forget and in my top   restaurant experiences of all time dined at the chef s table and i would highly recommend this option i truly think it is the best value and you can t beat the experience the entire staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating the restaurant occupies a beautifully renovated greenhouse with a large on site fresh herb and veggie garden there is no set menu as each day is different and depends on what is fresh and ready to eat from their local growers and suppliers it is not vegetarian but i would say that the bulk of the courses are veggie centric wow what they can do with veggies bas the head chef was fantastic his passion for his work is evidenced by the amazing flavor and presentation of each dish i would be a strict vegetarian if i could cook like these folks each of the   or eight or nine courses was paired with wine champagne and the sommelier took the time to describe the drink and the logic behind the pairing she tessa i believe her name was was kind enough to print out the wine list for the evening for us the restaurant is located a bit outside of downtown amsterdam so a car cab is necessary but well worth the drive be sure to book far in advance particularly for the chef s table will definitely be back visited in junein the past this was one of my favourite places to have lunch the food is delicious and very fresh the menu changes constantly and i have no complaints there however it is not cheap and therefore i was extremely disappointed when having lunch to have to request service we wanted to order a bottle of wine and were left sitting for a long time whilst all the tables around us were served and we were ignored the situation did not improve after the main course had been served we were not asked if we would like a dessert or coffee they just ignored us we managed to catch the eye of the lady who was clearing tables and she was kind enough to bring us our bill i don t know when i last had such poor service and will not be hurrying back it is such a shamei went to de kas with a small group of friends for lunch and had a fantastic experience the restaurant has an amazing location in the middle of a park that provides a nice break from the city the food on the set menu was fantastic and the portion sizes were good the meal included a white fish and several appetizers all garnished with vegetables grown on site in the restaurant s greenhouse the set menu was fairly priced for what they give you while slightly hard to find from the city center this hidden gem is well worth the tripthe setting is fresh and setting welcoming food was good but it is expensive for what it is best service i have received in amsterdam beautiful restaurant i would go again and recommend it for a special occasionnice cuisine in a perfect spot the staff are friendly and helpfull just prepare to pay a lot still a must go place to feel the amsterdam ambiencealthough the service is great the place beautiful and the food fresh and well made it s not for everyone the only available menu put you at risk that big part of your meal doesn t fit you expensive prices especially in wines made it too risky too trythis is a great setting in an old but modernized green house this was chosen for us by the concierge at the hotel as i wanted something away from the touristy area it was a   euro taxi ride but the experience if not the food was worth the drive this location has a fixed menu for the night for all patrons it happened to be a fish night when we went and it was ok but not worth the   euro s it cost would suggest you book it yourself and ask what the menu for the evening will be to ensure it is something you wanti just had a fantastic dinner at de kas we were a group of   and had a nice space where we could speak across the table without being disruptive to the rest of the restaurant the location is beautiful both inside the restaurant as well as the view and the gardens that surround it the food is almost all locally grown or raised extremely fresh and wholesome no menu whatever is in season is what is prepared and it is delicious highly recommendi visited recently off of the back of strong recommendations first impressions are fantastic the service is polite professional and friendly plus you really can t help but be drawn to the assortment of plants being grown in the part of the greenhouse that still serves its original function the dinning room is perfectly converted the food however is not quite to the highest standard it is still very good but struggles with too many flavours fighting for attention i would have thought with the concentration being on producing their own ingredients that each would be given more carethis place was really innovative when they started organic food from their own ground after years it s still providing great value quality for money we went for the lunch menu and it was really goodwith a reservation we visited the restaurant as a mother day evening celebration as previous reviewers have noted the restaurant serves a fixed choice menu at a fixed price but will provide alternatives if diners have an allergy or an aversion to all or part of the choice offered for our visit we all chose the   course fixed choice menu with wine pairings to match at a cost of some   euros per person the starter course that evening was a medley of three different dishes a grilled baby cos salad with croutons and old dutch cheese a white asparagus with egg and jerusalem artichokes and a quail roulade with beetroot the medley was well presented but did not provide outstanding tastes the main course comprised a filet of roast catfish wrapped in serrano ham and served on a bed of black lentils with bok choy the fish was cooked to perfection but again the dish did not have the wow factor one might have expected the desert course was an excellent rice pudding with a rhubarb coulis a white chocolate saboyan and pistacho ice cream overall the ambience of the restaurant is unique and tables are far enough separated as to not be bothered by adjacent diners the service was both pleasant and knowledgable although a minor glitch did occur when after an inordinate wait we had to request our desert course however the manageress did apologize for the glitch and offered us complimentary coffee and petit fours for the delay upon departure the two mothers in our party each received a tomato plant from the adjacent hot house in summary the restaurant is worth a visit from the ambience alone but the limited menu and relatively high prices for the fare on offer are detractions to the experienceexcellent service very professional the starters were very good and various the ingredients are natural only seasonal vegetables the location is very nice it is situated in a park with a pond and a couple of chimneys where storks have their nests fish and meat are cooked in a very natural way the menu is fixed by the restaurant you can only specify if you re vegetarian or vegan it is a take or leave it situation the dessert was very refreshing and not too sweeta pleasure in every way there s no menu you just have what s fresh and available that day but of course they will accommodate any special eating or dietary requirements we went there for lunch today and it was a joy service excellent and food really fresh and delicious please note that public transport is by tram not metrobest food best location best service i had dinner at de kas with my boyfriend who is a chef and had a beautiful experience in a unique locationwhat a wonderful place to spend your evening it was one of the highlights to my trip and i spent my  th birthday dinner here i made the right choice the food was wonderful and the atmosphere was even betterour friends treated us to lunch here the building is beautiful storks and birds in the park it is located inside beautiful flowers and surroundings the interior was also nice very open and bright as it is made to look like an atrium we were greeted in a professional manner and taken to our reserved table the set menu was nice their take on beet soup was delicious portions were an ok size perhaps not large enough for the men folk service was ok we often had to serve our own water and wine which is fine but when you are paying such a high price for the experience this is something that is usually done for you dessert was nice not amazing even though i liked the experience i left feeling like i wanted more or expected more this place has great pr and is known to be the best amsterdam has to offer but i thought it was very good not quite deserving of all the accolades and top notch reviewsthis place is top notch we had the chef s table on a recent monday and it was an amazing experience really one if the best i have been to anywhere but be prepared we arrived at   and left at     literally closing the place down the food was phenomenal as mentioned here but i think the service is what really takes the cake so very comfortable yet very professional and very accommodating the setting is beautiful this restaurant is a real gem and not to be missedthis is da place let s have a restaurant in a greenhouse and we did own vegetables and herbs and stuff friendly staff carefully made food nice wines and cozy atmosphere away from the towns fuss very nice and freshabolutely worth the trip to the suburbs fantastic settings and teir use of home grown vegetables and local raw ingredients and wine really works de kas isn t cheap and it s located a bit out of the centre but it s an experience well worth the money and the tripthis restaurant is a stunning space de kas has gardens in which they grow some of the vegetables and ingredients that they use each day the menu changes with what is available daily this is a set dinner so each course is a surprise the food was beautifully plated and very good service was excellent we really enjoyed our meal herewhen we first arrived the service was excellent and the magic was built up from not telling what to serve until it was time to get the food on the table so far it was great but when we were asked for what to drink they could not recommend any good wine for the food which i felt they should have been possible to do easily the food was ok but not something extra to be honest good and well cooked but not meeting the expectations after the introduction of the restaurant well worth to visit once just because it s a cool place and nice with all local foodwe had an amazing meal from start to finish the service was warm and helpful the space is beautiful and charming with a great view the sesonal   course meal was amazingthis is exactly what you want a bit away from the buzzy centre but easy reachable with the tram number   the place is beautiful and approaching it from the street already gives you an idea what will happen next service is professional and friendly the set menu is very good no outstanding taste experience of a specific ingredient but the symphony of taste is a lasting memory all fresh all bio all good good wine menu and a lot of attention to detail we will be back   euro fori have wanted to visit this restaurant for many years since sarah raven mentioned that it was the inspiration for her greenhouse restaurant at her gardens it is quite a long way from the central attractions of amsterdam so you may want to factor in the cost of taxis if you don t want to walk to the tram late at night it is set in a small field and you walk across a short bridge to reach the restaurant which is in a large modern greenhouse setting service was friendly if a little slow for us the menu is a set   course menu but they will take into account things that you don t like vegetables are grown in the greenhouse and all products are local and well sourced the food is quite simple but tasty and we enjoyed being able to have matching half glasses of wine with each course we have a lovely relaxing evening and recommend a visit you will need to book in advance as the evening we went it was fully bookedlargely home grown or at least carefully selected vegetables fish and meats end up on your plate here it is a classy but not a conventional restaurant freshness jumps off your plate i have been     times now and have not been disappointed ok jazzed up grilled onions as a starter is pushing it a bit lamb fish have alwys been wonderful not cheap but worth it more than enough staff that is enthusiastic and able a rare combination with attention to detail cosmopolitan atmosphere is uplifting recommend it to anyone who has not completely lost his her sense of curiosityfrom the moment we sat down we were greeted by a friendly staff who started our evening off with a glass of sparkling wine our meal was absolutely delicious farm to table style dining is something we enjoy loved the three starters served family style the wine list has some good french selections our favorite we did the cheese course and it was quite tasty after dinner we toured the greenhouse with tommy one of the chefs which was just phenomenal to see and hear how much they grow hassan was our server who was just a joy we will definitely be back hopefully in nicer weather to enjoy their beautiful patiogluten free has never been so tasty we understood that the restaurant only served one fixed meal each evening i am gluten free and my husband does not eat fish therefore we called ahead to see if our dietary requirements would cause a problem they assured us they could accommodate us they did much more they had special gluten free bread for me when i arrived so that i could enjoy the snacks at the table anyone who is gluten free knows what a treat this is and unexpected we had a glass of sparkling wine and enjoyed the beautiful views of the park the three appetizers were delicious again they fixed one of them special for my husband who does not eat fish the main course and dessert again fixed gluten free for me were scrumptious the meal was well paced and the service was attentive without being fussy i highly recommend this restaurant and will visit again when in amsterdam bravo de kaxeverything about our experience at de kas was perfect we went with kids and were all treated so well the menu was perfect both the adults and kids loved their meals can t wait to visit againfirst time we have had a meal where we have no choice of food to order this restaurant makes one three course meal each night based on fresh ingredients available you either like what they choose to make or you don t if you like this concept this is a very fine restaurant three small appetizers served to everyone family style then cod as main course and couple desserts half our group liked the food half were less than satisfiedi visited de kas last week and was left quite underwhelmed by the experience the setting itself is beautiful and i was excited to see the greenhouses where the produce is grown the service was attentive without being too fussy however we were served by many staff which i wasn t too keen on if i m leaving a tip i like to know who it goes to sadly the food wasn t as interesting as i was anticipating the starter was a cold potato salad a bean broth and an oyster the main was chewy guinea fowl with accompaniments which added nothing to the dish and the desert was a trifle type arrangement the white chocolate ice cream on top was the highlight of the menu no flavour or excitement and the oyster apart i d say the ingredients didn t reflect the price of the menu there wasn t much cooking involved and most elements could have been pre prepared earlier in the day it s a shame i d travelled a distance to try de kas and had really been looking forward to it i won t be returning on my next visit to the citytake a taxi to this restaurant in a greenhouse make a reservation the food is solid not extraordinary it is basically a set menu but they will adjust to any food requestsa must when visiting amsterdam located slightly outside city center kas offers a great lunch dinner experience great ecological food served by very friendly staffi should have taken susan s comment seriously i was fooled by so many great comments anyway i couldnt wait to take my daughter there it was a long way from where we stayed but since it had so many good reviews i thought it would be a nice thing to do with my daughter we took   trams to get there regardless of   minutes on the trams when we got there we were so impressed with the setting the place is gorgeous the staff was wonderful however the sad truth is that susan was right once we sat down we were served with italian olives mushrooms and bread for the first course soup salad fish appetizer and the main course was another fish the soup was ok the salad had no taste whatsoever and for the appertizer i only could taste the salt in the fish and no other flavor no spices after that i thought maybe the main course would have some flavor but sadly it tasted the same as the appetizer tasteless although the fish was a good fish the only item we enjoyed eating was the bread i left the place feeling very disappointed especially traveling so far and spent that kind of money for lunch for those who are looking good fine food this is not a placemy wife and i and another couple were going to amsterdam in january and we were looking for interesting places to eat i came across this place on the internet and immediately thought that it looked a little out of the ordinary a converted glasshouse in a park that grows a lot of it s own produce in attached glasshouses and has a set menu i e you don t choose and the food is brought to you we were able to book a table on short notice it was january and essential that you do as it gets very busy through most of the year turned up in the snow and thought a greenhouse in the snow in winter a lovely warm welcome and corresponding warm restaurant were what ensued the menu was explained and we were asked if there was anything we didn t eat there wasn t but they would have organised an alternative we also took the option of having wines matched to each course their choice what followed was a wonderful dining experience each course a surprise carefully presented and cooked to a tee the selected wines went incredibly well with each course and again lovely not knowing what was coming not cheap but as a special treat this is top end plus when we were leaving the snow was coming down quite hard and they gave us an umbrella to get to the taxi don t worry about sending it back they said one of the previous reviews slated the food and the wine as they were surprised at what came don t go with a closed mind and you will enjoy every minutehaving booked this restraurant well in advance and coming from scotland to amsterdam for a long weekend with the girls we were looking forward to this very much it offers a fixed menu for a week at a time and the location was quite central and the entrance and the restraurant was lovely that is where the good review ends i m afraid we went to our table and already sitting on all the tables were stale bread rolls the waitress was attentive and nice and did ask if there was anything we didn t like which we answered lamb mushrooms the starter was a seletion of   items a selection of beans in olive oil a salad both of which were tasteless and low and behold oysters that on further investigation did not look like they had been cleaned the main was guinea fowl it was over cooked over powering and the items that accompanied this were pretty pointless on a plus i enjoyed the dessert which was trifle my only critisism here would be the apples still had their skin on my   friends did not enjoy the dessert when the waitress came to clear the plates i had left all the contents of my main meal and they didn t say anything we paid the full amount and promptly left having read some of the other reviews i would suggest others to try but to have a very open mind about the items that may be served to themamazing experience great to eat w european food that wasn t overly salted or drenched in butter chefs let the vegetables and food speak for themselves simply wonderful the service deserves a special mention have never been treated so well by the friendliest of staff who were incredibly attentive yet it still felt like we were given space and left alone lovely venue not that far out of town  mins on tram can t recommend enough sixth time to amsterdam and the best meal we ve ever had there book in advance we were lucky and got a cancelled tablewe had dinner with all the family   fantastic environment and nice personnel were the only two positive aspectsqualitt of food disapointing a menu that pretended to be creative but was simply basicthey only have a surprise menu that you are not supposed to know in advanceand they came with oysters can you imagine my kids they almost vomitedbut the worst came with the wine selectionthey brought terrible unknown german wines so bad that i officialy complained and i must say they did not includ it in the billin conclusion i am not giunge there any moreand my family neirher nor our friendsthis is a must if you are visiting amsterdam and your budget allows there is a set menu but they do accommodate food allergies etc a wonderful space to dine in and very friendly and warm staff but of course the best part of the experience was the food delicious we were immediately served with bread and olive oil olives and mushrooms then the set menu was explained to us and substitutions agreed   little starters duly arrived they really do know how to combine their ingredients but for me the best bit was the main course the best duck that i have ever eaten perfectly cooked with no trace of fat and a flavour which lingered well until the dessert a course i usually avoid but once tasted had to be polished off an evening to remember do go there if you canthis is a bit of a foodies place particularly putting your faith in the chef to choose your meal but was excellent meal with lovely fresh ingredients the wait staff were terrific while pricey if you are on a budget well worth the splurgethis was hands down the best meal we had during a one week trip to both paris amsterdam while always a bit nerve wracking when there s no menu to pick from each and every dish they served was top notch and delicious even my girlfriend who can be a bit picky at times loved her meal highly recommend you eat here next time you re in amsterdamour visit to de kas was pure joy the whole concept takes locavore cuisine to a new level when the cooks use the vegetables and herbs grown directly in the greenhouse attached to the restaurant the set menu was well balanced and the flavors were great the wines offered to go with the menu were great too we also liked the interiors very airy and light well it s a greenhouse after allwhat an amazing surprise i was lucky enough to go here on a business dinner first of all the place is in a greenhouse and they grow a great deal of their own food   km movement as it is called in europe there are three set courses and on the night we were there all were just amazing we had just been in italy for almost a week and this blew away anything we had in italy our service was great wine was great food was just mind blowing the food all feels very light and healthy if this were in my hometown i would go at least once a month if not more the quality of the food is worth the price we tried to go back before leaving but they were fully booked i will tell everyone i know to go to this placewhat s outstanding about this restaurant is the location and the atmosphere the restaurant is essentially a renovated greenhouse which gives the place a night light and open atmosphere it is thoughtfully designed and the surroundings are comfortable it is situated within a park so you get an almost countryside feel as you approach it while walking around the park you certainly don t feel like you are in one of the busiest cities on earth the staff and service are excellent and very friendly and happy to make time to chat to the diners the food was very good the menu changes based on what s available from their own gardens and local suppliers so you can always expect something new they were very happy to take my dietary requirements into account gluten and mostly lactose free overall it was delicious and went down well with some excellent wine recommended by our waiter a nice place to go to if you re looking for something a little different be sure to book early though i tried booking five days in advance and they were full however they put me on a waiting list and called me three days later to offer me a tablehad read up about this place and it didn t disappoint the unique building is a fabulous talking point the food divine and the service excellent thoroughly recommendedthis restaurant did not disappoint i have read a lot of the reviews and we chose this restaurant from a food blog and some other reviews online it is a fantastic restaurant approximately  km or  mins by tram   central station leaving point the restaurant is absolutely beautiful in its decor a rebuilt greenhouse glasshouse that was redone from its original blueprint the place has been open for over   years now and its absolutely gorgeous the ambiance is fantastic with tables that are large and far enough away from any other patrons that you won t be bothered we went on a tuesday night and the restaurant main area there are a few areas which include function rooms etc wasn t that full perfect for us the food is sourced locally or grown within their own glasshouse or offsite on their own farm and you can tell the food is fresh and terrific the menu changes regularly to allow them to use their own freshest ingredients we had dinner which gave us a   course meal including   starters a main and dessert the food was great and i won t go into specifics so you can go and enjoy it yourself service was a grade prompt friendly knowledgable and with a smile we went on a short tour after our meal to view their greenhouse and the other various areas of the restaurant a really nice touch our waitress was a grade normally you would need to book we did it online via email and received our confirmation we probably didn t need to book for the night we went there but i would definitely recommend booking to avoid being turned away this was the best meal we had in amsterdam other recent restaurnt highlights were viajante town hall hotel londonwe recently celebrated our wedding anniversary here people aren t kidding when they say it s a bit out of the way when we were trying to get there the tram conductor told us that due to construction the tram would not take us all the way to the restaurant we d have to take a bus then walk we exited the tram and took a taxi from the city center it was about eur   i d highly recommend this option the restaurant boasts an impressive glass walls and ceiling the space near the bar especially the fireplace is particularly inviting the food was very good loved the carrots mustard and olive pre appetizers and the sourdough bread that came with them as others have said and dietary restrictions were accommodated the lamb the main course was served very rare when the server noticed that i was barely eating it i like my meat medium well she offered to bring me another one and did much better they brought a special plate with a couple of sweets and congratulations written in chocolate in honor of our anniversary overall a pleasant dinner but i would not say that i was so blown away that i d make it a must for each visit to amsterdam it was a nice experience but probably a one time visit for methe greenhouse very organic and not something you see everyday the kitchen was open and the fact that they had a kitchen table was also just amazing very chic and the service is something to write home aboutwe have been there already two times once as a couple and a second time with a group of   persons both times the experience service and the food were very good the place has a unique charm its a bit off the centre easy to get there though but this is actually an advantage as the surroundings park and a greenhouse are very relaxing and let you forget the craziness of the city centre the majority of veggies are from their own production there is also a nice selection of wine and they are willing to prepare for you a special menu in case you have some allergies fully recommended whenever you are looking for a romantic dinner dinner with friends or family or you just enjoy really good food service and atmospherea full pack restaurant pretty setting nice decoration not too quiet not too loud amazing food and great service if you re looking for fine dining in amsterdam this is one of the places to come the dinner menu is always a surprise i was a little scared that the main course would be steak or some heavy meat since i m not a big fan but luckily it was an amazing fish but don t worry if you re strictly vegetarian they got you covered as well if you re a tourist it s a little far from the city center and the main attraction but tram   goes directly therei had supper at de kas along with my colleagues recently the ambience of the place is fantastic the staff was very courteous and treated us with respect we has three dishes for the first course all diverse and quite tastefully aranged one for the second some places have two and one dessert the ingredients used were fresh and the preparation was quite appetizing and tasty the attention to detail was very nicely done the person who served us explained us every dish thoroughly being a fan of cookery shows it was easy for us to understand but for others who were amongst the uninitiated the server explained in brief about th preparation of the food item on their plate we had people with multiple diet preferences and the food served catered to everybody without discrimination frankly we indians are not used to french food or haute couture in food as some people may put it but the experience that we had at de kas has definitely helped in altering our mindset and made us more open as far as experimenting other food cultures is concerned i am sure i will be viiting de kas pretty soonvery refined dining without pretension accommodating service beautiful plates of food stunning surroundings and ambience if you go in the summer make sure you check out the surrounding park frankendael too one of amsterdam s better lesser known parksmy wife and booked our table ahead of our visit to amsterdam because we got the impression from the web site that eating here was going to be special we found it to be not just special but spectacular on arrival we walked over a wooden bridge in the snow and semi dark to the park and were then greeted by the sight of the illuminated glass house and its large old industrial brick chimney we were shown to our table and i had to marvel at how this old industrial site now felt warm fresh and welcoming the wine was a little expensive so we ordered the cheapest which was pleasant our pre starters arrived carrots and olives an unusual mixture but they worked well together the starters consisted of three slightly warm dishes presented together and we were advised to begin with the soup followed by the scallop and finally the vegetables each dish was gorgeous but then i started on a salad and i complained to my wife that some of my vegetables were bitter but we soon agreed that this was purposeful and worked because the flavours complemented and contrasted wonderfully between each mouthful our mains of fish were also very good but rather more conventional and our desserts and coffees completed our dining but there was more to come we were offered a tour of the growing section of the glass house building and we had great fun examining the plant beds of pumpkins tomatoes and rhubarb we were even allowed to pick some vegetables to take away with us the service at the table and on tour was exemplary throughout we felt that they valued our custom i would rate this place very highly and i will not come back to amsterdam without visiting this place again it was expensive but it was also good value for an outstanding dining experiencewe were really excited about this restaurant and maybe our expectations were way too high but as well travelled foodies we are up for a challenge the restaurant is quite a way out of town and the restaurant emailed me instructions on how to get there which i applaud we didn t realise tat you have to check in and out f the tram otherwise yr ticket for an hour is void so we had to pay twice would have been cheaper to take a taxi the restaurant is visible from a distance and the setting is lovely and so is the restaurant i knew it was a set menu but thought there would be choices from set things on offer but no   starters one being anchovies on toast with cauliflower purée we had to remove the anchovies as neither f us like them marinated raw fish with pickled vegetables would not have been on my list f favourites nor the very bland consommé which tasted of nothing the presentation was good the main course did not disappoint and was a beautiful piece of hake which was te best part of the meal wines are very expensive too and the staff were on the stand off ish side and stood fro a whie chatting to each other and not serving anyone all in all it was a disappointment for us and too expensive for what you actually received the surroundings are lovely and it s very stylish and clean on the positive noteslove the scenery the staff were very attentive and the food was fresh delicious and beautiful to look atwe had to stop off in amsterdam before our flight home to australia i didn t want to waste this last night so after much researching i booked de kas from the moment we stepped off the tram in the snow and looked across the road and this beautiful building glowin in the park i knew i d made the right choice we were greeted with such warmth and as i d mentioned on booking that we were heading home the next day after five weeks in europe we were asked about home and how we d enjoyed our trip all of this was lovely and the setting is just amazing but the food was perfection its a degustation so probably not a lot of point reviewing what we had as its changed oftenmy girlfriend and i dined here at the end of our stay in amsterdam and couldn t recommend it more highly if you re looking for something special the menu changes frequently to accommodate particular herbs fruits and vegetables home grown in the nursery during our time garlic chicory and rhubarb were used as ingredients in the restaurant s various dishes not necessarily all at once the restaurant a renovated greenhouse was visually spectacular at night the large windowed hall was lit by a series of cool and unusual green and blue lights the atmosphere of de kas was definitely a highlight of our night and has no parallels in anything we had experienced before the waitstaff were attentive and knowledgable and the food seasonal fresh and thoughtful we couldn t fault any aspect of the restaurant and look forward to returningi have been going to de kas each season for the last ten years or more every season because their fare consists of the freshest seasonal produce which they prepare in a new way each day there is no a la carte menu card just three courses for lunch and four for dinner the ingredients are mostly all organic some herbs are grown in the greenhouse de kas means greenhouse in dutch since they had a vegetarian patron for an extended period although the restaurant caters for all sorts of food preferences i being a vegetarian always get delighted the ambience is very relaxed in a renovated greenhouse with a beautiful park surrounding it the service is always friendly and quite informative i suggest having matching wines for each course totally brilliantwhat a treat to have made it to de kas for our last meal in amsterdam which was lunch on a monday will definitely be booking a dinner reservation for the chef s table on my next trip as all the other reviewers mentioned the grounds are absolutely gorgeous it s just a magnificent restaurant and one of a kind experience seating for lunch was outside on the patio by the herb garden area it was a beautiful sunny day and along with the gorgeous setting made de kas one of the highlights of our trip to amsterdam because i typically love sampling several dishes at restaurants the downside for me is that they only offer a   option prix fixe menu which i believe changes daily it s not a big deal though because the meal was very lovely the fish vegetables and all other ingredients were of highest quality and tasted so fresh and delicious the lunch prix fixe was about   euros on the high side for lunch but definitely worth it for such a special treatwe enjoyed this restaurant from start to finish they have everything just right which believe me is not easy in a restaurant from the minute you walk in the door you feel looked after and at ease the no option menu i love you just know everything is going to be fresh which it was they ask you have you any allergies or is there anything you don t eat then the adventure begins fantastic starters a little cup of cauliflower soup braised chciory with shavings of early rhubarb a little shell of beautifully cooked shrimps and a scallop main course confit of duck on sauerkraut dessert thin slices of blood orange chocolate mousse and a crisp candied slice of blood orange all dairy free and truly delicious what more can i saythe setting is fabulous we sat in the nursery area which had a more relaxed feel than the main hall the service was very good and attentive although there is only   menu they take care to ask if there is anything you don t want can t eat the food was absolutely delicious a bit expensive but definitely worth it for the whole experiencegreat setting in huge greenhouse ingredients are seasonal and local with many grown on the site wine selection was good and the waiter helped us choose wines that matched the food and weren t that expensive we were served by daniel who was friendly relaxed and attentive the restaurant is clearly passionate about ingredients and great foodmy husband and i went to the netherlands and de kas to celebrate my  th birthday and our  th wedding anniversary we booked the chef s table because we are foodies and had heard about this restaurant we were not dissapointed each dish was creatied uniqely for us out of fresh and local ingredients by the chef or one of his assistants they made a point of coming to our table and explaining the dish ad the thought that went into creating it the chef even took us on a tour of grounds where they grow much of their food the fresh ingredients and the pride in creating the perfect blend of flavors just for us made it a meal of a lifetime absolutely incredibleas you walk through the restaurant you can have an idea of what you are going to see in your plate a large green house with stunning vegetables and a wonderful atmosphere the food was well presented and deliciouswas invited here whilst on a business trip and although i wasn t paying i would have been happy to such was the quality of the food and service the staff were great explaining our dishes as they brought them out and keeping our glasses full too all with a smile although some people have said it s not that easy to get to when we jumped in a cab in the dam square and asked for de kas restaurant we didn t even have to give the address the driver knew where it was there is just the fixed menu but this included   starters the quail i think was my favourite the main was haddock on a bit of pumpkin and the dessert was a very nice trio that included a very smooth chocolate ice creamgreat location great food great service great experience enough said will definitely go back againwhat an experience from the food to the service everything was top notch from the moment i walked into the dining area i was blown away and knew it would be a night to remember the waiter was extremely polite and knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant owner and all ingredients used to prepare each dish we were provided amazing olives bread and celery salad to begin the courses then a   small plates for the appetizer of the   course dinner each plate was phenomenal my favorite being the veal tartare with a shallot tarte for the main course we had brill atop a spinach risotto with glazed carrots best fish i ve ever had which was cooked to perfection for dessert we has chocolate truffles with prune ice cream at first this sounded questionable but was actually very delicious and citrus marmalade after the meal the head chef took us on a tour of the green house and kitchen which was awesome everyone at de kas was a delight and provided the best dining experience i have ever had service like this is one in a million i would highly recommend de kas for anyone traveling to amsterdamde kas grows most of their own vegetables and herbs in their organic market garden you have to walk true the indoor garden so remember where you but your step the restaurant might be too far outside of the center for some and can be a bit tricky to find the first time we had a   course menu for     and the only one that was to my liking was the one of the three small starters not the main course or the dessert even that i love sweets maybe i was not in the moodcame for businessmeeting meal became centerpiece of the evening instead of dull businesstalk perfect lambchops all wines perfectly chosen by waiter and the angel introduced me to px if you dont know that sherry thats a must with all cheese for me nowwent for dinner with a group of colleagues from work it was a set meal and enjoyable i had a lot of different things that i would have never eaten at home it was nice but expensive thank goodness work was paying it is set in a lovely venue but it was summer and light late into the evening so i didn t get to see the lovely candles and lights dancing on the glass of the building during dinner i enjoyed my meal but i don t think that i have the need to go again unless someone else is payingi am vegan and the chef custom made all of my dishes and the server explained each of them to me in detail it s a bit on the expensive side but everything is grown there it translates to the greenhouse except for meats which are locally purchased i highly recommend this restaurantde kas is amazing the food service and surroundings were flawless when we visited the menu included salmon lobster and veal steak we did not have a negative word about any dish we were served it is expensive but worth every penny and i would love to returnde kas is an amazing restaurant that you must go to while in amsterdam as other reviews have stated the vegetables are grown on site in glass green houses our meal was paired with wine and was wonderful bring your camera so you can take pictures of the meal it is a taxi ride from the city center so arrange for a ride back to your hotel this experience was well worth the pricemy husband and i would like to think that we have highly developed palettes however we discovered that this is not actually the case we came to this conclusion when we dined at restaurant de kas whereas all of the food was wonderfully prepared and the service above par we are just not adventurous eaters the meal started off with great wine we payed for the wine pairing option appetizers were good until we got to the duck which was so fresh killed that morning on site that the waiter noted that it might actually have buckshot in it he wasn t joking that would set the tone for the remainder of the meal much of which was food that could be described as a little odd keep in mind as i noted above perhaps we were just not cultured enough to eat at an establishment such as this with its lack of menu and limited substitution options my advice just be sure that you are okay paying upwards of   on a dinner for two that could be a wildcard meal based on what is being served that particular eveningwe recently dined at this fantastic restaurant the meal was in celebration of my birthday and i can honestly say it was one of the most memorable birthday meals i have ever eaten the location of the restaurant in a park among the glasshouses which grow all the wonderful fresh vegetables which the restaurant serve is exceptional all the staff were attentive and extremely helpful both my partner and i have food tolerances this did not faze the staff at all the set menu was adapted immediately to suit our diet all the courses were fabulous each element of of each dish was cooked and served at its absolute best the tastes were an absolute revelation never has beetroot tasted so amazing an absolutely amazing place we loved the whole experience if you get the chance to go you will not leave disapointedan amazing place on the grounds of the former greenhouse of the city of amsterdam this restaurant serves it s own home grownvegetables fruits herbs out of it s own gardens the meat and fish and cheeses are all having a healthy reputation before they are allowed on your plate vegetables that have been out of fashion are rediscovered all in a beautiful setting of a spacious greenhouse not a place for a quick meal that would be just a pitty this place needs to allow you time to contemplate on all the sensations that are touching you tastebudswe as a couple would not eat in restaurants that would cost this much very often but i am glad we did on this occasion the waiters were so friendly the atmosphere was welcoming we were asked if there was anything we didn t eat and they said they would do their best to omit any ingredient we didn t like i am a vegetarian and was delighted with my food as was my carnivore boyfriend the only reason they would not get a perfect score is that the tables feel quite close togetherwe really enjoyed our meal here the restaurant has an attached greenhouse that grows various vegetables that are served daily at the market the restaurant itself is located in a park fairly central to the town   minute cab ride leidesplein square it s a beautiful structure with high glass ceilings the food and the service were very good the waitstaff were both professional and very nice they asked my son if he wanted to take a brief tour of the greenhouse and he and i really enjoyed it the food was also really tasty my wife had the venison which was cooked to perfection while my son and i had perch my only criticism of the restaurant and why i gave it a four rating instead of five is the limited menu basically they want to serve you what they have while that is laudible to an extent i want to be more in control of what i eat they wanted to serve venison which i usually do not like the perch was a backup they don t even have menus so i would definitely recommend this restaurant for its food service and ambience just recognize that the menu is limited so be prepared to take an adventureone of the best meals i have eaten in   years on this earth farm fresh organic feast from the garden to my plate thank you for making my wife s birthday dinner excellent top notch service what an experience one i will always remember it was defiantly worth the train ride from our villa but be prepared to pay for it don t expect to pay for this meal on a budget and it was worth every penny go go gowe had an outstanding dinner at de kas in amsterdam the restaurant is in a greenhouse and prides itself on its sustainability this is great but it has some disadvantages there is a seasonal menu only   no choices when we were there the main course was fish if you eat anything and like to be surprised this is the place for you the food preparation was great the atmosphere outstanding this place is popular with locals very crowded overall i think it is a must see if you take the bus or train note that the restaurant does not front the street you have to walk through a park to the greenhousea nice and tasty place with food from local ingredients vey tasty and nice high prices and you need to reserve a table in advancei would give it a   if i could the combination of atmosphere farm to food concept and melt in your mouth deliciousness makes this place absolutely amazing as described in other reviews the restaurant is a greenhouse and you walk by the gardens where you food has grown as you walk to your table i can t remember the exact amount but the dinner is a flat fee per person maybe    ish euros and then the chef just sends out a great combination of dishes out of what was made available from their farms that week the service was impeccable as they take the time to describe each dish as it is brought out next time i am in amsterdam i am definitely headed back i cannot waitfirst of all the name de kas means the greenhouse and it is a greenhouse specially designed as restaurant the concept of the restaurant is to serve high quality food based on top ingredients even if these have been produced in a greenhouse not far away from the restauranti was truly amazed when i had the chance to have dinner at this restaurant with some customers of mine the first impressions blows you away this is a non typical restaurant a huge glass greenhouse which is a protected building setting atmosphere the service is excellent very friendly attentive and the food is superb the chef picks as much as possible natural products taste texture and most of the vegetables and herbs are coming from their own garden situated besides the terrace of the restaurant although the restaurant is big you never get the feeling it becomes noisy stressfull or they want to get you out as fast as possible they take the time for you so that you are able to enjoy this gastronomic experience at its bestwe had the great pleasure to dine at restaurant de kas while in amsterdam at the suggestion of our hotel aside from the aesthetic beauty of the building and the surrounding area the food is sublime harvested that day from the gardens chef works without a menu and just cooks whatever is fresh frankly i moaned my way through the meal it was one of the best that i have had all year and that is very high praisewe went to the chiefs table but from looking around this is a very popular restaurant in the middle of a park a trams ride from the centre of amsterdam it manages to feel spacious and being a converted glasshouse or greenhouse if you re from the uk is light and roomy the food is based on what s fresh and what is being grown at the farm   km outside the city as a result there is no choice other than allowance for vegetarians and allergies however the food we had was delicious and the staff were very friendly and could not have made us feel more welcome it even extended to an a cappella rendition of moon river from one of them who was a student from the conservatorium van amsterdam a great selection of wines complemented the excellent dishes given the changing menu you could visit every week without getting bored this is one place i will certainly have on my list for when i next go to amsterdamgot a taxi to this slightly off the track restaurant which is housed in a huge glass greenhouse style building there s no menu they just serve up what they ve grown in the greenhouse and their field we went for the wine pairing menu which is just   euros extra and the whole experience was exemplary every course was delicious and the service was perfect the home grown giant green olives were amazing if you are in amsterdam you have to go to this restauranti had the pleasure to have dinner in restaurant de kas for my birthday in february i was really pleased with the service and the food was really innovative and delicious i like the concept of growing their own veggies which gives the customer fresh dishes on the table it would be nice to eat there in spring or summer when there s still daylight to enjoy more the actual greenhouse style with lights coming throughwe went to de kas for our wedding anniversary meal in august chose it simply because of the interesting write up in the guide book so glad we did service was perfect friendly and helpful but discreet food was delicious and beautifully presented there is no menu choice just the selection of the day they will however cater for any particular hates or intolerances they made me a lovely tomato free starter lovely appetisers selection of   starters then delicious main and desert coffee and sweets we also chose to add a cheese course many ingredients are grown in the onsite greenhouses which you can walk through or sourced locally where possible our waitress was very knowledgeable about the wine list the restaurant was very nicely set out with enough space between tables views from the windows onto the moat were lovely green parrots flying through the trees as the sun set the lighting inside was lovely a really great evening and good value have already booked to take the in lawsin a nice surrounding very kind hospitality and good atmosfere we had a not very interesting diner the wines were goodabsolutely gorgeous food all sourced either right there in the restaurant or at least locally thoroughly enjoyable very good wine pairing excellent service absolutely faultlesshow much does the food matter to you if you like a marvelous atmosphere professional service and eating next to the place where much of your food was grown and if you don t mind paying a premium for food that is pretty ho hum de kas is the place for you went for a business dinner with a group and got the special   euro all inclusive meal there were some nice ideas but the ultimately de kas succumbed to the flaw so many dutch restaurants are prone to it puts beauty and form over flavor the food was bland the portions were small but it all looked great too much money for too little mediocre food the wine was great thoughsetting is great food is excellent and completely locally grown or sourced from natural sources it has its own green house where you can view the different fresh products which they growthis restaurant served some of the most uniquely prepared food that i have ever eaten there were flower petals little carved beets stacked up and carved chocolate on the dessert all kinds of special touches on everything we had little shot glasses of foam soup as an amuse bouche then a little piece of salmon with caviar on a spoon then a gorgeous lobster claw and arm taken out of the shell and arranged with curls of cucumber and tiny smoked shrimp tiny multicolored beets carved and arranged on baby greens on and on each dish more alice in wonderland like than the previous one the space is a greenhouse with jellyfish like glass lamps hung from the rafters it is huge and open and possibly the coolest place i have ever eaten except for a beach in the maldives i thought that this was the best restaurant that i visited in amsterdam i loved it and i highly recommend itour top chef margot jansen from south africa said it was on her bucket list so we decided to visit and we were not disappointed chef ronald kunis is passionate about the seasonal fresh produce and ingredients he uses which contributes to a great menu he took us on a conducted tour of the garden and we so enjoyed hearing about the different tomatoes herbs etc which are grown there de kas is a renovated hothouse with a friendly open look about it and the kitchen visible food combinations were exciting different and delicious i will be back be sure to book for eveningsthe setting is great a greenhouse in a park flanked by a picturesque herb garden inside there is a working greenhouse which produced the cherry tomatoes served before the starters the room is really uplifting to be in olive trees and glass the menu is a basic three courses without the option of choice three yummy starers to share a main course monkfish and a desert the wine was very good and not overpriced the overall experience was absolutely excellentthe setting is beautiful a huge greenhouse in the middle of a park from the moment you approach the glass building you know this is a different experience the room is bright spacious and fresh surrounded by the herb garden on one side and another greenhouse where they were growing tomatoes courgettes and eggplants both worth a visit the attitude of the staff is very relaxed and friendly they give you all the time to relax choose your drinks and absorb the place you are then introduced to the menu and its ingredients they are proud of their produce which is all local and most of it from their own gardens de kas offers a   course set menu of   starters a main and a dessert you can always add a cheese selection the dutch like their cheese delicious modern hearty food we loved itthis is a true market cuisine restaurant which is located in an old green house on the corner of a park just outside the centre of amsterdam easy tram ride or even easier taxi ride the food was fresh and delicious they also have a great wine list with lots of wines by the glass great value for money will definitely returnneed to book a week or two in advance great food very very freindly service nice location especially in summer not very touristic not very known we knew about it from a dutch friend all   of us absolutely loved itwe really enjoyed our experience at de kas excellent seasonal home grown produce resulting in great food service was exceptional would definately come back next time i m in amsterdamwonderful dining experience have to book well in advance food always good love the atmosphere staff friendly and professional no menus just seasonal choices and all to the highest standardone of amsterdam s best restaurants some of the vegetables and herbs actually are grown in the kas greenhouse de kas buys it s food as much as possible in and around amsterdam fantastic food drink not too formalthe building is a joy to be in and most of the veggies and herbs come from their own garden it is not cheap but worth your moneyvery good food and the restaurant is beautiful service is super nice we really enjoyed it i also had the best olivesi ve ever tried in my lifebeing a pescatarian who maintains an all natural kitchen i had high hopes for this restaurant the setting was a   and it alone makes the visit worthwhile but do not expect the food to compare to the atmosphereif you want to try one of the most unusual restaurants you ll ever see eat in make a reservation here restaurant is very large a part of a greenhouse but yet feels cozy you are invited to have yourdinner drinks outside in the back of the restaurant where there are more gardens it is all very casual and relaxed and jeans and shorts are fine the menu is set at    euros the   appetizers served together are not huge but filling after the pre dinner huge delicious olives and roasted beets the entree this night was plaice which was good even though slightly overlooked dessert was a light and wonderful sherbet custard fruit compote since it is a set menu call in the am to ensure you can eat the food if you don t like an item they will happily substitute anothera little out of the way from central amsterdam but definitely worth the cab ride absolutely special in every way food service atmosphere no written menu but server asks about tastes and anty dietary restrictions and chefs deliver flawlessly delicious beautifully presented meal i would definitely recommendfrom the time you walk thru the greenhouse full of tomatoes and into the conservatory dining room you know you are in for a great evening of fresh home grown vegetables wonderful and differently prepared meats sumptuous dessert and attentive service they are very good at accommodating any dietary restrictions there is no menu but the food is plentiful enough and very innovative and to be enjoyedwe me and two business associates had such a wonderful evening at de kas that when i just looked it up on tripadvisor to write a review it just hadn t even occurred to me that there could be negative reviews out of curiosity i read them all and basically didn t recognize any of the descriptions except maybe for the impressive bill because de kas isn t cheap and it shouldn t be the location and grounds are simply stunning and very very well kept the staff all know what service is and maintain a great balance between formal and informal we were served by a few different people and no matter who it was they all knew to speak english to us because my two colleagues are english speakers i m dutch frankly that sometimes was rather impressive since i wouldn t have a faintest idea of the english words for all the vegetables flowers herbs and some typically dutch delicacies because my wallet was stolen earlier that day my payment methods were slightly clumsy but they went out of their way to accomodate very sweet we were free to roam the greenhouse and garden in between courses they would just wait until we were back at our table before proceeding with the next course the food itself was simply delicious very original lush even and more than enough the restaurant was fully booked on your average tuesday night but still doesn t feel crowded i saw businessmen families with children suits jeans tourists and locals all equally comfortable will definitely again because i want to at least try a sunny lunch outside and a stormy rainy dinner under the glass roof see you soonthis was my second visit to de kas and it confirmed my positive impression many others wrote about the unique location and concept in a vast greenhouse serving mostly locally produced ingredients so i won t reiterate in detail as we arrived at     held up by a thunderstorm the service at most tables was in full swing the netherlands are famous for dining early and it took a while to place orders for drinks later on we were treated with full attention and the service was personal and warm with some trepidation we took the wine pairing they offered this can go very wrong in some places but we didn t regret it the wines were well chosen interesting and at   eur good value some small refills were not charged extra a three course menu with optional cheese or dessert is ca   eur and represents good but not outstanding value the menu is fixed but one can veto certain ingredients the strong point of the place are the fruit herbs and vegetables that are grown on the spot now in summer their quality is outstanding luckily they don t try to do too much with them and let the aromas speak for themselves for vegetarians the place is a treat bread seems to be home made and tastes very good altogether an enjoyable place that due its special setup will give a lasting memory of your visit the place is very popular reservation is essentialgood food all grown either in there own glasshouse or by local farmers no set menu so very good surprise worth a visithad a really lovely lunch here it s a beautiful conservatory building would be great for a party with a lovely herb and flower garden out back we were given wedges of sliced dressed tomatoes pulled from the conservatory about  m from our table delightful they tasted of tomatoes very unlike those you buy in a supermarket fresh bread and huge italian green olives completed the nibbles no menu as such just   starters to share among the two of us highlighting their vegetables grown in their farm outside amsterdam and served with edible flowers not totally vegetarian of course our aubergine came with veal sweetbreads main was a perfectly cooked white fish with moreish new potatoes and beans my description not really doing it justice all in all a really great mealwe missed out on this experience hours are noon to   and   to closing walking in at   was bad great space and a fresh garden for vegisand herbsour visit to restaurant de kas was fantastic and next time we re in amsterdam another city that feels like a place i must live at some point we shall return if you re considering a visit you ll probably know that the restaurant is the former old municipal greenhouse and a big part of its usp is that the fresh ingredients that are served in the restaurant are grown on site or close by with the menu being completely seasonal and changing once a week with a glass of wine in hand we were given a tour of the site and got to see up close the different vegetables being grown a really nice experience and it made the appreciation for our meal even greater we dined at the chefs table and ate from the tasting menu a collection of   courses with matched wines and our experience couldn t have been better the unique concept the food the service the atmosphere and interior were all fantastic the kitchen in turning out so many covers on a busy saturday night was as calm as could be it was great to see them working together with such finesse and precision in producing such delicious food it was a far cry from the kitchen nightmares we so often see on the tv here the service was attentive knowledgeable and friendly from everyone we met and we were even given a bag of the stilton and deep fried candied walnuts to take home as a gift from the kitchen guys i think they thought us crazy english sitting there ooohing and aaaahing over our meal and being verbally very appreciative rather than solemn and silent as many other folk must for dish details and some other shots of our night at the beautiful and unique de kas please visit my blog and then book your table you won t regret it http thegourmetkitchen co uk visits       some amsterdam shenanigans htmlfirst they put a lemon basil leaf in my bubbly which i was skeptical about but then i tried it then it grew on me and the rest of the meal was just as surprising refreshing and lovely they even managed to make my sweetbread fritters exceptionally balancedthe interior and setting is really nice unique in a way very welcoming and the almost invisible but brilliant lighting is a masterpiece the staff were ample and attentive even if at times quite automatic in their courtesy it felt more like a well oiled top notch fine dining machinery than being their guest but then that s what you get extremely rarely those days all staff on the floor on the day i was there were quite young which might explain a bit and there were a few negligible glitches and the lack of warmth due to stress i have nothing against the idea of fresh set menu every day as a person who can never decide and likes to be pleasantly surprised i am all for it actually that said there is always a risk of not hitting your sweet spot every time and this was one of those times for me i do not like overly spicy or otherwise intense food and i enjoyed the mildness of all the dishes but i have to echo some of the less positive comments here in that i found the food a bit too bland it was mild but not delicate or intriguing everything tasted its best the fish the fresh vegetables the meat but there was nothing intriguing about it i didn t leave feeling i ve never had something like this before oh and yes the dessert was nothing to write home about for me at least but i didn t mind as the cheese board was the best ever so i wouldn t mind no dessert at all after that the dessert comes as a part of the set menu the cheese board is extra and you can see why though by all means ask for it the other highlight was the organic bread both accompanying the starters and the one that came with the cheese board as actual bread is hard to come by in the nertherlands the absolutely brilliant ones we got were the more of a raritya wonderful restaurant in a great setting quite unlike anywhere else the food is lovely fresh original and always a surprise as there is no menu to choose from just the chefs choice of the day we visited with our   month old baby and she was well received which is always nice service was ok we had about   different waiters and by the last half of the night we were forgotten about which was a shame as overall this place is greatthis restaurant is located in the former council greenhouse of amsterdam located in the middle of a park with parking facilities nearby restaurant offers one menu per day for lunch and dinner fantastic food fresh and great combinations of fish meat and vegetables cheeses all own produces restaurant has a chef table with view into the kitchenyes you walk in to the most beautiful parklike area surrounded by living greenhouses and you eat in the big one in the middle most of the food is grown on site so fresh every day and the menu is only constructed on the day you arrive the service food quality and value for money is truly memorablethe location of this restaurant will remain all the life in your good remember to eat in this elegant green house is really an excellent food experience and time has spent happy due to an immersive ambient atmosphere surrounded by various and different vegetables crops staff highly professional and really able to involve the guest in the green house restaurant menatlity price correct according food typology and good choice of wines it s highly recommendable to reach the restaurant by byciclewhat a fabuloius atmosphere a fixed menu in a beautiful glass green house with superb service wonderful wine and food and daylight until     pm what s not to like for what this was the price was very reasonable this is a must do in amsterdam nothing like it in new orleansof us ate at de kas   weeks ago and we were all extremely impressed not only by the unique and beautifully imagined conversion of this former greenhouse into a cool sophisticated setting but by the wonderful food and the terrific service definitely worth the taxi ride since it s in a park on the outskirts of amsterdamgoing to this restaurant is a wonderful and total experience paricularly if you are lucky enough to go there for lunch on a day when the weather is perfect like i did as de kas s main dining area is located in a large glasshouse i imagine it would also be wonderful in the evening or in winter when it is snowing it is a beautiful restaurant in a beautiful location when the weather is perfect lunched is served on the terrace overlooking the gardens and dinner is served inside and pre dinner drinks can be enjoyed on the terrace the service and food is also outstanding you are nicely greeted on your arrival and promptly shown to your table within minutes you receive a complementary cob loaf of bread some divine basil infused olive oil plump fresh olives and marinated champignons if you have not been to the restaurant before the wait staff also explain that there is a set menu and inquire if there is anything you do not eat or are allergic to so that the meal can be modified to your needs and requirements you are also informed about the food coming from the restaurants own onsite gardens and their nearby farm on the day i went to de kas the set menu included each person being served   different starters and a main meal desert cheese tea and coffee are additional costs but i did not have any of these as the meal was sufficent there is a good varity of wines to choose from and you can purchase still or sparkling water guests can wander around the garden before or after their meal the restaurant is so easy to get to as you simply catch tram   and get off at the stop called hogeweg and walk across the little bridge over the small canal the tram actually gets you closer to the restaurant than a car or taxi could this is a special restaurant that i could not speak highly enough about and would return without any hesitation if i am ever lucky enough to return to amsterdamexiting atmosphere former greenhouse champagne with flower high quality menu a must see againvery nice food there is no menu but they take in account things you don t like or can t eat all the food is beautiful special and of course very delicious you ll have a special evening or day when you ll have lunchamazing location with the greenhouses that some of their food comes from being situated next to the restaurant food was of the highest quality had the cheese as i m not a dessert fan but was very envious of the desserts that a colleague receivedwe ate here for the second time in may   the first time in august   the first time was brilliant five stars for the food four for service the tomatoes during our first course so gorgeously fresh combined simply with diced parsley and olive oil that i ate them like candy a great sign considering i haven t had a great history with raw tomatoes our second visit was ultimately a dissapointment the dishes on the whole lacked a sense of inspiration and the quality from course to course and within courses was varied the food of our first experience last year offered a clear sense of form of wholeness across the courses whereas this most recent experience seemed slapdash almost lazy the combinations on the individual starter plates feeling incomplete and somewhat bland and the size of my lamb for the main course was a bit meagre i felt open to the experience but in the end didn t feel wowed on any level service was erratic for most of the meal staff seemed a bit too reserved and unavailable after a cheese course most of the other guests had left and so had some of the floor staff while the remaining staff seemed to have forgotten about us we asked about our dessert and the floor manager apologised and brought us some marotti campi xyris sparkling to say sorry but i left with mixed feelings it s a beautiful space with unpredictable service and food next time we re in amsterdam i ll likely go back to rijsel for dinner insteadif you are visiting amsterdam and looking for the ultimate hip dining experience then de kas is for you the restaurant has been created in the original amsterdam greenhouse and is an architectural and interior design work of art in itself throw in that the vegetables are all grown pretty much on site and any other ingredients are expertly chosen from top local and internationalsuppliers to provide a taste sensation you will long remember the menu is created each day depending on the available ingredients and is a set fare the service is faultless and fabulously friendly and the food sublime make sure to book well in advance you will not be disappointedbeautiful restaurant with a great theme of using organic produce grown by the owner etc etc all very noble but doesn t make up for the blandness of the food i had expected more distinct flavours considering the origins of the raw materials the olives were rubbery and too salty i was served plaice on my visit that was cold when it arrived at the table and dare i say undercooked and sloppy wonderful atmosphere lots of staff giving great service but i was underwhelmedif you like organic and bio foods this restaurant is a must it has a set menu of what s in season so you know the food is fresh the service is unbelievable and the decor and building creates a real experienceyour food can t get any fresher being that the majority of what will be on your plate is grown right on the premises service was simply fantastic always someone paying close attention to your needs had a wonderful tasting menu worth every penny fantastic wine list as well the interior design of the restaurant is what really stands out and gives this place the title of one of the best restaurants in amsterdam chef bas is a true artista place i would recommend everyone to visit because of it s location in a greenhouse in a park in the east of amsterdam perfect for a date or o bigger group of friends or colleges but what happened in the kitchen the fish was rather tasteless something ordinary in an extraordinary placewe prebooked on our last night in amsterdam the scenery and the restaurant itself was fantastic we loved the fact that they grow their own vegetables or most of them the retaurant is a bit noisy and its not easy to here what the waiters say some of them with very bad english the dishes were beautiful with lot of fresh spieces but still it lacked a little taste all in all this was a very good expreience but not full score due to taste and lack of charm amongst the waitersone of the better restaurants in amsterdam in unique location food was good not out of this world but the service and environment made it a lovely evening i would recommend this restaurant in spring or summeryou are told what you are going to eat the explanations to each dish are a joke these olives came from italy who really cares and where did the mushrooms come from master chef gone mad with flavours that don t match would not recommendfirst of all i would like to thank my gourmet friend can s that recom this beautiful restaurant to me many people explained the details of the restaurant there is not much to addnot cheap but it is worth iti have never seen so attentive friendly well informed restaurant staff in my lifewhat a place this could be i used to wow work colleagues by taking them there i had my wedding party there and it was fabulous   years ago the location is absolutely breath taking when the weather is nice a greenhouse in the middle of a park all organically grown veggies and locally procured meats and fish the interior is beautiful service superb but the food could be better i found the   starters at the last visit rather boring and almost tasteless the meat dish was small slivers of veal tongue tender but nothing special the main was catfish which was not very exciting quite a change from the days when everything was delicious the wine menu remains interesting especially if you wish to try the wine arrangement that comes with many surprises if they could only get the kitchen right it would be one of the top amsterdam restaurantsbeautiful food beautiful staff beautiful setting as you get off the tram the area is a little shabby but in a moment you are in a tranquil and lovely park setting in the middle sits de kas the old greenhouse which has been transformed into a most elegant bright and stylish restaurant the food is immaculately presented and as fresh as can be based on masses of organic vegetables herbs and flowers it is paradise for veggies or meat eaters we had the most mouth watering and delicious riesling   euros a glass and the whole lunch was about   euros for two worth every penny staff are delightful and attentive i would go to amsterdam from uk just to eat hererestaurant de kas is an amazing experience let s start with the location the restuarant is a former greenhouse of the city of amsterdam with fantastic light inside due to the glass roof and big windows the evening sun gives a unique light and atmosphere inside the interior is peaceful and stylish with clean lines and absolutely not overdone then the food it is amazing most vegetables and herbs come from their own nursery you can have a peak at it as well and the rest of the vegetables and meat from farms in amsterdam area you can really taste that nothing is from a jar of a supermarket chain everything is pure we were awarded with tomato jam courgette flowers marinated beetroot and other unique dishes the ingredients and menu change from season to season that s why there really is not a menu to be viewd before you go you can either keep the dinner as a secret or the ever so helpful and friendly staff will tell you if you so wish speaking of which the service is fantastic every single staff member is friendly professional and helpful your table is being cleaned all the time and asked if everything is as you wish it would be but not an annoying way you really can take your time and enjoy their amazing food without anyone interrupting your culinary experimenting i definitely recommed to eat in de kas if your budget allows it is not cheap but whenever you can you should aboslutely reserve a table and enjoy an evening in this atmospheric restaurant it is located outside the centre of amsterdam but with an easy connection tram   from city centre of amsterdamamazing food great service perfect location this isn t one to miss you need to book well in advance it was about   euro s for a three course dinner wine and service so not a cheap eats place but was one of the highlights of our trip i d love to go back one daylocated some miles outside amsterdam s centre de kas the greenhouse is beautifully located amidst its own gardens and serves excellent food and good wines by the glass in a lively atmosphere the restaurant can be easily reached by public transport after which it takes a little walk to the sitelovely bio organic food very friendly and welcoming and well educated staff excellent choice of wines great menu very classy entouragelocated in a greenhouse where the restaurant grows its own food service great food very fresh and an interesting place to visitthis restaurant is off the beaten track but can be easily reached with public transportation tram from centraal station it s housed in an old greenhouse and very popular with locals and business groups centered on organic and local food the meal is determined by the chef you advise of allergies or strong likes or dislikes and dietary restrictions and the chef does the rest the appetizer was composed of three items and if the meal stopped there i would have been completely satisfied so delicious the vegetarian entre did not measure up to the appetizers but seriously the appetizers were so good i didn t care the staff was terrific and even insisted on giving us a greenhouse tour before we leftwhat an enjoyable evening with my wife in a beautiful setting the greenhouse environment like many have mentioned made for a great evening the food was delicious and the duck for the main course was cooked perfectly the service was courteous and prompt the desert was my favorite as it was a chocolate cake with rhubarb mmmm i would imagine the summer months bring a wider variety of produce to use this restaurant only uses things they grow or harvested locally the food and service performed up to its reputationin a greenhouse you will spend some good time either for lunch or diner with a beautiful modern and delicious food it s a contemporary looking restaurant with friendly and competent staff really unusual place out of the touristics roads in the south suburb of amsterdam but worth to try welldonei went here with   friends on a short weekend away to amsterdam this was one of the most amazing restaurant venues i have ever seen it is set in what is a former greenhouse complex which lends itself to an amazing setting if you can go whilst its still light out and stay when it gets dark you ll be treated to an excellent evening the food is just as great there isn t an ala carte menu but instead they do a fixed menu that varies with the ingredient that they can get the waiter was extremely knowledgeable on describing the dishes and recommending a wine pairing its worth the   minute cab ride to see this side of amsterdam s culinary expertisevery good tasting food and extremely good servicenot at all central amsterdam but an easy tram ride and worth the effort for a different kind of dining experience in a converted greenhouse i did imagine that it might be lacking in atmosphere but was pleasantly surprised it doesn t have a warm and cosy feel but lively instead the food is a set menu no choice from there own gardens instantly able to offer a vegetarian menu i didn t like the cold the poached egg but my dining partner loved it so you take risk everything else was wonderful carefully constructed an executed to a high standard service was good quite inobtrusive which i like not the cheapest place but well worth it if you can stretch the budgetthis wonderful restaurant located in a park grows their own vegetables and herbs and the food here is delicious it is a fixed menu so prepare to be surprised and if you have lots of food preferences or allergies this may not be the place for you the service is excellent and they are very proud of their unique building a modified greenhouse and their approach to cuisinehere they grow their own vegetables and serve them in delicious dishesnot cheap and set menu secial glass building old glass house service and quality very goodgreat food great place though on the very expensive side if you have the money go for itreally good food but above all beautiful space great project greenhouse local producers and all very nice place to have a special dinner dateplace is great food is good but attitude from staffwe dined quite early at de kas which made it all the more enjoyable as the menu was a complete surprise and we didn t see what other people were eating around us we chose the wine pairing menu which was just amazing the wines were top notch and did complement the food nicely the quality of the ingredients shone through in each dish and the presentation and quantities were just right the pudding was exquisite the best venison i ve ever eaten everything about is was just brilliant i also love the concept and the setting of the greenhouse the service was excellent as well really friendly and they provide a good explanation of the wines and the food that you re given loved it it s also quite a romantic spot i would say quite pricey though but worth the splashwe enjoyed every aspect of our dinner here the food was great simply amazing how some of the vegetables tasted and the deer was superb we choose the wine arrangement which matched the courses perfectly the atmosphere was very nice although a greenhouse is of course big and high place the way the tables and other objects were arranged and the lights were designed made it almost cosy and the service was good as well we have been here twice and will certainly come back againthe giant greenhouse is about four kilometres from the city centre and easily reach by tram no   alight at hogeweg there s a warm welcome and the freshest of food your table attendant explains the four or five course set menu and you sit back and wait for the freshest vegetables and meat in a balmy atmosphere not to be missed for fresh quality food reservation essentialthe food and wine pairings were spot on very cool room and service was friendly love the concept we ll definitely be backfood was great you never knew what was going to appear next got a tour of the greenhouse and saw what they were growing all of the food was excellently put together and waiters were excellent toothe place is fantastic it is an actual greenhouse restored perfectly to accommodate a beautiful restaurant the food is great and the pleasure to sit in the greenhouse is a fantastic experience the menu proposes mainly local food thus making the experience even more interesting definitely a place to try in amsterdamand great prices lot s of groups and business people not very romantic but definitely worth the experiencethis restaurant is a bit out of the way i e not in central amsterdam the setting is really nice and the restaurant is beautifully design we ate here on a relatively quiet evening the service was friendly and competent given the emphasis on fresh vegetables i expected those to be the highlight of the meal but in fact the vegetable dishes were the biggest disappointment the fish we were served was very well prepared and we both really enjoyed it but the vegetables were overcooked or cooked in a sauce or pastry which hid the true flavor and besides the fish everything was served cold even the pastry vegetable dish which is not really what one craves on a cold winter evening overall we were pretty disappointed by amsterdam standards this restaurant is quite expensive i don t mind paying for great food but this was not great it was simply average taking into account the fish was good and everything else was mediocre perhaps it would have been better in the summertime but we won t be back to find outnice place with very good food staff is excellent knows what they re serving and happy to answer questions the location is quite nice an old greenhouse i d been there   years ago with school grew up four streets east of there it really is the old greenhouse not a rebuilt lookalike structurei took a number of my international clients to de kas recently we had a wonderful evening the service was first class and incredibly knowledgeable on food and wine the food was devine and so incredibly healthy all my guests had a great evening we will visit again at the first opportunity thanks de kasgreat first impression spacious excellent service innovativeon the mibus side poor coustics echo very few products from the green house disappointing main dish we were served duck my wife do not eat duck and i hate sweet cooking i was offered to get a less sweet duck serving but was not in the mood of another surprise aflter a long cold daywhile i can accept a fixed menu i cannot undertand why they is no second choice on the main dish irrespective of how convincing the staff tried to be when i arrived i though the price was fair after the meal i thought it was too high the staff were excellent specially cornelias and ian nb i would give it another tryhow is that for a title this is my second time at this restaurant i was fortunate enough to be included in a small birthday dinner so i do not know the cost pricey i am sure but incredibly special and memorable service was outstanding the food was top notch the atmosphere was fantastic and conveyed every moment that were eating food grown on site we had food restrictions and the way in which we were acoomodated was mind blowing this is not a drawback but a comment i did feel that i was in a room of special occasions for some that may not be attractive for me i was too busy enjoying my friends thankful for the delicious food and laughing the night awayoriginal location great food perfect for both a business meal or private dinnerseverything here is good the atmosphere is great and the food superb wonderfully presented and tasty fresh and organic definitely a very good experience in the not always good food panorama of amsterdamgood food adequate service housed in a greenhouse of the former amsterdam municipal nursery safe choice if you ve run out of ideasi have been to the kas when it first opened about   years ago a fresh new concept and i liked the food i visited again   years ago and i was not very impressed but i felt not so wonderful myself so i blamed the lack of surprise on my cold last november friends invited us and now i know for sure the food is okay but not very special everything is supposed to be fresh of course what would one expect from an expensive restaurant but the staff uses this so called freshness as an excuse to offer just one menu at a cost of nearly   euro per person the fish was very bland and tepid the meat was okay but not more than that the starters were as often is the case the best part of the meal the restaurant was crowded al lot a tourists who read tripadvisor i am afraid for us we live in amsterdam it has been our last visit to this overpriced restaurantthey grow their own herbs and other ingredients everything is fresh and well thought out good service and lovely atmospherethe food was perfectly paced and each dish was indescribably delicious in it s uncomplicated purity the interior was well designed with soaring ceilings crisscrossed with subtle black matte painted industrial pipes presumably for heating they somehow managed an acoustic miracle in that we were almost completely unaware of conversation other than our own the staff was delightful in their courteous professional and in my case compassionate service i had been knocked to the ground my a hit run bicyclist before entering the restaurant the staff immediately helped to clean me up and provide a welcome ice pack for my injured head and continued to unobtrusively make sure that i was able to enjoy an otherwise delightful evening from start to finish yes it was expensive but so very worth itthis restaurant set in amsterdam s former municipal greenhouse should not be missed the room is dramatic beautifully lit very comfortable tables well spaced perfect noise level even in a full room they serve one basic menu that varies daily but they do accommodate individual food allergies and preferences the food is creative and interesting without veering into bizarre or experimental our servers were charming and the meal was served at a perfect pace likely a consequence of the limited menu the wine flight for   euros included champagne a dry white german red barbara german ice wine and a lovely lambrusco style to finish our visit involved some unusual circumstances my partner was knocked down by a bicyclist in front of the restaurant and the entire staff could not have been more compassionate or helpful i enjoyed every bite and every minute at this lovely restaurantduring recent visit to amsterdam had the opportunity to dine here with collegues from work unique dining experience in which you pick the number of courses you want and let them know what you don t eat the chef makes the choices nice surprise in not knowing what the next course will be food was very good you can see the pride that goes into each dish the kitchen is visable from most tables wine pairings for each course was excellent ambience goodrestaurant in a large modern greenhouse serving a fixed no choice menu of locally grown organic food experience will depend to some extent on whether the daily dishes are to your taste stunning setting though understandably quiet on a foggy monday lunchtime in november with friendly professional servicefood cooked from homegrown ingredients you walk in through the greenhouse a great changing menu with surprising wine selection and a very unique concept with the greenhouse building it s an experience worth having if the weather is good starting with champagne in the garden is a top optionthere is no menu to choose from you just tell them what you dont eat and they will bring you what the chef decided to cook that day i ate lunch and dinner there dinner was very crowded but lunch was very nice very bright it is not cheap but worth the moneyhaving dined in some great restaurants in both asia europe and the us de kas is up there in my top   the food is unique but not in terms of wierd cuts etc but rather the quality and medley of food texture and taste it is not cheap however is a great business dinner or special occasionlovely lovely place service food and  hours of dinner the location is a refurbished greenhouse and the   courses set menu is delicious the wine was really good too carmenere the little touches are well worth a visit i wish i could go back nowde cas is famous for growing it s own vegetables or sourcing them locally had an opportunity to visit after hearing amazing reviews however the food was not too great it gives a good feeling that you have eaten organically grown food but at the end of the day it is expensive our average spent was   per head and you would want more for your moneyit took me four days to get a table but due to the excellent help the resturant confirmed a table for two a day before our arrival i could see why we had trouble booking a table as it was busy that said it should not detract from the excellent relaxed atmosphere of the location and the resturant team who explained the dishes served the food was well presented and had the taste buds tingling with flavour and joy the whole team could not do enough for us the building itself was unusual in a very nice way with lights leading to the main entrance the resturant also called us a taxi this is well worth a visitbeautiful grounds when we walked in on the small bridge there were flowers falling from the trees outside couldn t have scripted a start to a romantic dinner any better the restaurant itself is a modern gem it is a remodeled old farm house a huge tree sits in the middle of the restaurant with a full glass ceiling worth it on its own it was a fixed menu with champagne to start with an edible flower from the grounds in the glass and the first three courses were salads my wife and i agreed they were the best salads we had in ages not many places you can go to will throw   salads on a fixed menu but the greens were so fresh picked from the restaurant s greenhouse that day i could have had two more courses the beets with creme were especially good  th course was cooked perfectly with a chocolate dessert overall it is an extremely unique experience and we are privileged to have had the opportunity to dine therefirstly what a location to enjoy and evening a fantastic setting with a real attention to detail and quality the waiting staff were there to explain all the different courses ingredients and wines we had opted for the wine tasting menu and spoke fluent english as well the menu is a fixed menu set on the day dependent on produce but they did accommodate a dish change for me cant eat cockles which was no problem at all the food was excellent throughout with the cheese course my favourite if you go for the cheese don t go for the port try the   year old sherry they recommend with it it was just fantastic and has changed my opinion of how good sherry can be overall a top quality restaurant and dining experience just make sure you book up as it is always fullhad a really good meal here with my wife from the outside it looks quite odd but once inside it s actually a really great space with one main dining area and a couple of smaller private areas for around     the menu is ever changing so you kind of get what you get and after the first starter came up we were a little apprehensive about what else we d get however apart from   dish we really enjoyed everything else main was particuarly good duck and the chese platter was also good nice wine list too service was great very attentive and friendly without being in your face it s certainly not cheap though but that didn t sem to put people off we didn t sit down until  pm and the place was still packed and on a monday so deff book in advancei ve eaten here a few times good for client or team dinners also a pretty good date place there s a few private semi private tables you can get for work events plus they used to have a two person table in the kitchen great for a date not sure if they still do though food is good fresh creative but is always a set course only big downside never had a problem with the service wine list is nice decent mix of prices plus some creative options if you re in the area it s well worth the trip although a bit priceyi first ate at de kas   years ago and found it to be as delightful as ever the service is good particulary by dutch standards and the food is creative and fresh plan on making an evening of your meal and be sure to leave room for the cheese course visit the greenhouses at the restaurant and get their a little early to walk around the nearby park we saw the stork s nest but missed the stork you may be more lucky than usmy girlfriend and i went to de kas back in march had a terrific experience first of all if you want to experience de kas make sure you make a reservation i was staying at the marriott and when i arranged a cab with the concierge he seemed concerned that i did not have a reservation i took care of this   weeks prior to my arrival in amsterdam the restaurant is located in a very nice park the green house gives it a surreal type of experience my girl and i took part in the wine sampling which was an excellent value it s really nice to get a different wine paired with your dishes the food was pretty good really fresh vegetables and fresh meats i remembered getting a cheese tray and one cheese was a french goat cheese that was way too strong for my liking but everything else was really good the staff were friendly and the majority of the customers were all dutch this seems like the type of restaurant dutch people go to for special occasions the marriott concierge advised me it is holland s flagship restaurant and truly dutch i m really glad i experienced this restaurant and would recommend it since the dishes change daily there is no set menu you have to come here with an open mind for trying something new the food and wine for two was great value as well around  euro great experience i will go back the next time i make it to the damjust imagine a big vegetable garden in the city of amsterdam with a couple of green houses in the middle hosting a restaurant that is de kas in amsterdam aperitif outside in the gardens chef and bar table with   people great service delicious fresh food fantastic atmosphere good wine for a reasonable price a unique combination which has its price and is absolutely worth itthe salad picked that morning was a delight the salmon and the duck were perfectly presented the dessert was sweet enough to take the enamel off my teeth a very enjoyable and unique experience in an unusual and slightly remote setting wine selection is very goodwe initially tried to bag out on our reservation but as our b b host had made the reservations and they had called the inn to confirm that afternoon we dragged our weary selves onto the bus for the   minute ride outside the heart of amsterdam to de kas for dinner and i am so very glad we did restaurant de kas is a stunning greenhouse conservatory converted into an equally stunning restaurant i so wish i had been there the night before when a huge rainstorm blew in rain pounding on the glass roof would have been a sight to see they service a prix fix menu with consideration taken for your likes dislikes limitations etc we just told them to bring it on and they certainly did lovingly prepared from start to finish all the dishes featured fruits and vegetables either gown in house or locally and all other components of our dishes were sourced locally they were even so kind a to offer the recipe yippee for the basil ice cream that i raved about a nice touch really a don t miss experience for travelers to amsterdam if you are a foodie you will be in heavenwe have dined at other farm to table restaurants although de kas is more modest in its ambition than a place like blue hill at stone barns in westchester new york it is a very satisfying eating experience we opted for the wine pairings and the choices in all cases were unexpected and absolutely perfect accompaniment to the dish the bread was a treat flavorful and crusty our only quibble is their insistence on bringing all three starter dishes out at once one couldn t help but feel that the ones we weren t eating were getting cold and it was hard to resist rushing through to get them all we loved the changing light as the night came on through the glass watching the full moon despite the size of the room and the number of diners it never got too noisy we thought the vegetables were bursting with flavor and the guinea hen served with smashed potatoes orange reduction and roasted tomatoes was delightfuleverything perfect what else could i say healthy food perfect environment great and attracting idea surrounded by the green eating flower salads that match perfectly with the dressings they re served with if you like big chunks of meat and crowded places this is not your place after three entrees and one main course we were undoubtedly not in need for much more maybe a dessert included in the price would do let the well trained personnel explain their philosophy and enjoy the dinner as we didin every respect this was an excellent evening the food was interesting and extremely well done but it was the exceptional and gracious service that was a shock we ve not had the greatest service during this   week european excursion but de kas was brilliant three young ladies served our table at various times their personable professionalism would have improved a meal of macaroni and cheese we will undoubtedly return to amsterdam and de kas will be a mandatory dinner for usthe sun shone so we sat outside with our apperitifs watching the green parakeets fly by and the storks nesting on the chimneys in the garden the service was friendly and very efficient the food was good but you don t get a choice as it is all seasonal we had been tipped by locals to try the wine sharing option which was   different wines pp over the meal and this was nice a lovely meal in a beautiful location for euros   each a lovely treatprobably the best restaurant i ve been in amsterdam the food is excellent always different and exciting visually and culinary check out my photoswe recently brought a dozen world renowned physicians to de kas just after a large conference on lung cancer and what better place to celebrate clean air and wholesome fresh food in amsterdam than de kas set in a quiet park with storks nesting atop what was once a smokestack de kas is a world away from the city and a perfect place to enjoy wonderfully prepared fresh local food service was outstanding and prices were quite reasonable given the extraordinary meals we experiencedthis was our  th visit to de kas every meal has been outstanding and quite a treat i will admit the first three times the dessert was a disappointment we are chocolate lovers and there was no chocolate but this last time even the dessert hit the mark this is a highly recommended destination and if you ride your bike to get there you get to work off the meal once you are finished i also recommend getting there early and taking time to enjoy the surrounding parkare you one of those people that a never know what they want to eat b want to eat healthy c want a dining experience you have never had before i m all   and this place delivers all   very well they grow their own herbs vegetables and flowers in the adjoining buildings i can t believe i ate flowers tonight their dinner menu is a   course meal with whatever is in season and whatever they are growing at the time and have fresh and ready they actually have a winelist at a reasonable price that goes with the meal that was fantastic as well the entire meal was the best i ve had in ages the main course of place fish was remarkable highly recommend if your in amsterdam the location in obscured park off the street that once you find is a beautiful setting call ahead for reservations as i can imagine it gets packed on the weekend i went on a wed night and it was packed if you are going to splurge this is a great value for splurging i spent about   euro including tip whereas i spent   euro at a comparable place that wasn t as goodthe setting is beautiful a greenhouse in the middle of a park and they serve vegetables grown in their own garden next door we always visit it there is a set menu of good quality but it seems not all reviewers were as pleased as we were on the several times we ve been there service is good for dutch standards which are not as high as you will find in other parts of the world we usually take friends who are visiting amsterdam and we consider it among the city s top ten placesthis is one of the best restaurants in europe in my opinion and one of the fine examples of dutch innovation and creativity the food was so inventive and the flavour and texture combinations a complete work of art we let our wait staff completely professional choose our wine for us to match the dishes because we did not know what we were going to be served they made fabulous choices for us the atmosphere tables lighting use of space is brilliantly conceived bravo to the creative genius behind this superb restaurantvery unusual restaurant set in a massive greenhouse very good food esp vegetables home grown and a wonderful ambience with no piped music highly recommendedfantastic food such interesting tastes combinations of flavours without pretension service perfect friendly and helpful great building clean lines with loads of space and light we had a fantastic lunch and will definitely return when back in amsterdam the menu is dictated by whatever is in season or available on the day so if you are a picky eater you should go somewhere else i recommend you take the waiter s offer to serve the wine best for the meal de kas is easily reached from the centre of town on tram   get off at hogeweg took us about   minutesde kas offers a surprise menu what the chef thinks is fresh that day from its own greenhouse and gardens and organic suppliers they will adjust for food preferences allergies etc so don t worry about the surprise aspect extremely pleasant atmosphere in a park very polished service a nearby table knocked over their wine and the response was swift but gracious the prix fixe dinner at     euros was for   starters an entree and a dessert wine extra a special occasion restaurant perhaps the value was not as high as for a place half as expensive but the restaurant is definitely someplace specialdishes with no taste at all veg supposedly coming from the local greenhouse service ok but global atmosphere you will find anywhere in the world let s call that globalizationi m afraid it was all style over substance setting awesome growing their own brilliant but the service was sketchy due to inexperience i guess even the front of house looked little more than a teenager and the food well it just wasn t good enough the starters was rushed out before we d barely had time to take our wet coats off   out of the   were bland underseasoned we then waited nearly an hour for our main courses quite how i m not sure when they are churning out the same dish to everyone again this turned out to be bland underseaoned and this time cold to boot i would still recommend de kas as a concept it s fab and we could have just been unlucky and gone on an off night but i m still scratching my head now as to how food so fresh could taste of nothing when it is being grown right there on the premises hmmmthis restaurant is in a perfect setting and the concept of eating food grown in their own garden is great the service was good to start but as the night dropped off it really fell away which was disappointing the food we had was all nice but really lacked flavour which really let the entire evening down i would still recommend going as it has so much potential and maybe we just had an average night but for a set menu all meals should be hot fresh and flavoursome this should be a   star restaurant if done wellenjoy the food purchased from local producers and own gardenswe had a lovely meal note that there s no menu they serve what s fresh timing was a bit off it felt initially as though the kitchen were serving the complete seating but they turned that around it s not the easiest place to get to on public transport from the center best to take a taxi the meal included some amazing duck and super fresh delicious vegetables we loved the farm tomatoes and olives out on the terrace with a drink before dinner absolutely lovely viewthis must surely be one of the best if not the best restaurants in amsterdam there is no menu the food is chosen by the chef according to what is in season and looks best in the restaurant s greenhouse we had three starters comprising delicious innovative salads followed by excellent asparagus as a main and then pudding all accompanied with a well chosen wine selection the staff were charming and informative the setting is a greenhouse and in fine weather you can as we did sit outside and enjoy the sun and the gardens not to be missedi must confess i was disappointed with de kas with all the hoopla from some of my fellow reviewers i was expecting something amazing bottom line is the food was boring i did not notice any interesting flavors in fact it seemed like they forgot to finish the food prep there was no noticeable spices on most of the food we had a salad of greens that came with the vegetarian main course that had a tiny amount of some white liquid dressing on it that had no flavor at all the main course consisted of   asparagus spears   large white   smaller green with what appeared to be a glob of mayonnaise on top mixed greens underneath and some peas although you could taste all the ingredients well there was nothing interesting about it my mom could have cooked it there was also a scoop of mashed potatoes with some bacon fat mixed in to them that were tasty the three courses of starters had one tasty bit a tempura lobster tail however again this fell short it would have been far better with some kind of sauce dressing to enhance the flavors overall i must say it was a big disappointment especially for the price never againi was very impressed with de kas the setting is a beautiful greenhouse where the chef prepares a creative menu consisting of the best seasonal vegetables and meats highly recommendedate here on the       to celebrate my wife and i s first wedding anniversary a note i had mentioned once in correspodance from the uk while making the booking we were made to feel as special as the day was from incredibly attentive service to a special dessert plate with congratulations written in chocolate in a totally non tacky way we chose the works apperatif of moet then a   course dinner selected by the chef from what was fresh that day you are in a greenhouse after all we also chose to have the accompaning wine selection too finishng with a chilled sparkling red to accompany dessert from start to finish the experience because that is what it is not just a meal was incredible cannot fault a thing book early as it is very popular and dont scrimp this is a special place our meal was over   euros for the   of us but a night i will remember foreveris is a restaurant or a greenhouse well it is both a lovely setting light and airy and a very warm welcome large tables with plenty of space between the open plan kitchen and the park where the restaurant is situated the menu may not suit everybody it is a set menu as they grown their own produce and use it to serve what is in season they do ask if there is anything you don t eat or any food allergies and are happy to vary the mune accordingly we were served freshly baked bread olives and some delicious roasted carrots we were brought three starters to share then a main course and a selction of desserts the food and service was fantastic and we were also treated to an impromptu tour of the kitchen and a chat to the chef this is not to be missed before we left the waitress asked if we would a photgraph taken in the greenhouse where they grow som eof the produce this is probably one of the best restaurants for food and service that we have eaten inwe have been to de kas numerous times now over the last  years and every time is splendid business lunches ladies who lunch and casual smart all mixed in relaxed atmosphere with a relaxed but delicious menu it s quite nice to sit down and your order is already taken with the daily menuthis was my first time in amsterdam my college found de kas on the internet we spend a lovely spring evening there for a business dinner party of   people walking through the green house gives you high expectations to the food there was fantastic smell from all the fresh herbs the restaurant has a fixed menu that is chanced daily and we were not disappointed meal was extraordinary i tasted combinations of vegetables and spices i have never had before the starter was creeps stuffed with spinach with a slightly taste of lemon whauu that was great the main cause was fish perfectly fried it was accompanied by the most surprising salad with a combination of chopped eggs and fresh flowers everything was served very delicate unfortunately i did not take any photos of the food but every plate was a little artwork of color smell and taste the staff had their attention on our table all time and no one ever lacked wine or anything i have no complains at all from this very nice evening and it was not even expensive de kas is now a must visit in amsterdam would recommend it to anyone both for a business dinner and for a romantic dinner for twode kas where we ve been once before truly lived up to expectations we were entertaining for business purposes   people yet we felt only intimate service and fantastic food staff were excellent and although a   minute taxi ride form the centre of amsterdam well worth the visit restaurant is set in a greenhouse with the fresh produce literally growing outside could not recommend it more highlya fantastic experience the food is very good matched only by the service excellent and varied wine cellar although rather expensive the de kas experience is a definate must do whilst in amsterdam the restaurant is a tram ride out of the centre but the tram system is easy to use be prepared to spend a lot of money if you want the whole de kas experience the staff are very very nice people approachable and amenable we would definately recommend itwonderful atmosphere haute cuisine and a great experience overallrestaurant de kas is the best restaurant we ve found in amsterdam the food is delicious and fresh and i love the element of surprise the menu changes daily the staff were attentive and knowledgable and the atmosphere in the restaurant is relaxed but vibrant at the same time we had a fabulous night there and would highly recommend it to anyone my one suggestion is to not eat too much in the day before you go becuase you get served plenty of food on the night for a restaurant of this calibre we found it to be great value and will definitely be returning to de kas when we re next in amsterdamwe ate at some pretty fabulous restaurants while on vacation here in amsterdam and we dine out regularly in top restaurants around the world for that matter i chose de kas based on reviews and the website looking for an alternative experience to the status quo and an actual green vegetable while on the road we were not disappointed the food just felt fresh beyond the simple and spectacular taste in attendance was a college student who does not eat vegetables the comment of the night was i d eat more vegetables if they tasted like this i thought it was unique that the starters were presented family style each on a single plate all at once and one was able to choose how much food was to be on one s plate we did the wine pairings with dinner and the sommelier was invaluable refilling our glasses with the most remarkable wines at no charge and paying special attention to the level of our water glasses the comment by another reviewer about feeling like being in a gymnasium was totally off base the point was to feel like you were in a greenhouse yourself witnessing the simplicity and elegance of natural food and who knows maybe experiencing plant life personified four of us dined and drank for about   usd which i felt was well worth the money i had promised a dining companion i would not review this restaurant for fear of drawing too much attention to it most patrons it appeared were local not an american in sight however we just had the most enjoyable experience and i would certainly return in the future and can t help but recommend it to othersi booked the chef s table as a suprise for my boyfriends birthday we we were warmly welcomed and given a glass of champagne on arrival with edible flowers olives beautiful i had never liked them before mushrooms a fresh loaf we watched the kitchen and all the chef s run like clockwork presenting dish after dish of sublime food fresh from their organic farm the menu changes every week to give their regular s a different experience each time they dine at the chef s table we had   courses each with a different wine to compliment the dish a different chef presented and explained each course to us our waiter who looked after us for the whole night treated us as if we were the only two in the otherwise very busy restaurant the atmosphere was romantic and calm despite being sat in the kitchen the service incomparible everyone so accomodating and attentive to your every need a tour after the meal by our waiter and the opportunity to sit in the main restaurant for desert to gain another perspective entering the restaurant you have to walk across a long plattoon over a park lake lit up with lanterns so pretty a must if you are visiting amsterdam and especially if you want to treat someone special to something special and yourself there are other menu options that aren t as expensive as ours was to be at the chef s table but if you can afford it it is well worth it and i would say quite reasonable for the night you will enjoy the price i have input below is inclusive of everything wine champagne desert tour but not tax or tipwe went here after reading the reviews on ta and were not disappointed it was a such unique dining experience for me i really enjoyed the fact that you don t choose what you eat the dishes get brought out to you and explained what they are at the tabel they do ask if there s anything you don t like first we were served fish for both our starter and main which was cooked perfectly i ve never had fish literally cooked to perfection it was a delicious meal even though it probably wouldn t have been what i d choose myself very happy tum tumsthe restaurant is also a glass house where they grow most of their herbes and vegetables the food is great it is next to a park and has a large terrasse so in summer its extra specialwould fully recomend going here if in amsterdam it is defintiely something different to experience the food was excellent we just went with the chef daily menu and it was very very good there was bread on the table on arrival fresh brown bread very nice then for starters there was   seperate things one of them being oysters which neither me nor my girlfriend wanted so they changed no problem and gave me a chicken starter and my partner a vegitarian starter to accompany our other two starters each a lot of food the staff were brilliant very nice and friendly and also very helpful and informative regarding the food the food really was excellent we both got a salmon main course and it was presented excellently and also tasted very good it came with little potatoe cheesy croquettes which were devine but the overall experience of the place being on a kind of farm and in a greenhouse and the friendliness of helpfullness of the staff all combined to make this a brilliant and beautiful dining experience would definitely recomend it to anyone very romantic and very different but good different fantastic place as regards cost well we had   gin and tonics   bottles of white wine   sets of starters   things each   main courses   coffees and it came to   so its not overly expensive given all we got   bottles of wine being about   euro well worth it and is a bit special reallyi will keep my review short this time this place is fantastic absolutely the best of all the restaurants we ve been to in amsterdami have now been twice to de kas and both times i have found the service excellent and the food pretty good in a town not really noted for fine dining the main restaurant is at one end of a largish greenhouse complex with visible plumbing for the ventilation of the complex however in a strange way this adds to the spartan elegance of the place and it is quite different in this respect one can wander around the other parts of the greenhouse where herbs and some vegetables are grown for use in the restaurant although when pressed they would admit that the produce also comes from other wholly organic greenhouses elsewhere the food is good fresh organic and while interesting it is not spectacular to the point where i would want to come every month or so there is only available a daily set menu but they tend to bring   or   of the dishes together at once so the   dishes on offer translate to a more normal   course menu this is a brave restaurant as they offer only what they feel like the best produce they can get on the day and so your dining choices are fixed before you even come if you are a fussy eater then i recommend you telephone before dinner and ask for the dishes on offer that day one time i had quail and the other time it was fish both times the food was cooked well but rather simply which did let the freshness of the ingredients speak for themselves personally i would have preferred a little more finesse in the kitchen but my dutch partners really loved the simpleness of the cooking so i am a little bemused the wines on offer are good with a wide selection from both old and new world wines service is friendly professional and unobstrusive finding the place by walking from where i was staying in rivierenbuurt was not easy especially the first time as one had to cross a little bridge into a park before coming to the buildings however it is definitely one amsterdam experience to enjoy and there is a certain dutch ness to the spartan simple but elegant approach which is appealing perhaps more to some people than othersthe fact that they only serve one set menu per night almost had us not go there we would have missed out on a great experience the de kas occupies an old greenhouse in a park in amsterdam and it is beautifully illuminated at night good wine list with a sommelier who knows his business great service very attentive yet discret the motto of the cuisine is that the veggies they serve were plucked the same day and you can tell that the produce is super freshwe read about de kas in some magazine back home and decided to try it we made our reservation online which works perfectly nice we took public transportation to the restaurant but would recommend a taxi its a long walk and the location is of the touristmap but now we have tried the trams we were greeted by our hostess who took our coats and escorted us to a very nice table for four the chairs were very comfortable and the entire setting very appealing and charming the restaurant is actually a very big greenhouse and the restaurant grows all their own vegetables as the waitress explained there s only one menu so the choice was only if we wanted the wine taster menu as well we did except for our children of   and   we were there a bit early     but soon the restaurant actually filled up and this was a monday but they are always full so order ahead and this was the only minus the waiters were really busy and the wait was a bit long between the   super dishes but they were always smiling and nice to us but back to the dinner the food was absolutely super both exciting and pleasing and we can absolutely recommend it and compared to cph prizes it was absolutely fair we had the champagne for starters   course menus wine tasters wine in between and the cheese platter also and all in all it was   euros absolutely worth it please note that there are several seating possibilities from the restaurant were we were seated to the bar and the chefs table all with charming featuresafter reading all the good reviews my husband and i wanted to eat at de kas for his birthday dinner but even trying to make reservations a week in advance they were already booked for all   nights we were going to be in amsterdam so we settled for lunch and were very glad to made the trip to the outskirts of town it s about   minutes by tram no need to take your car either as there s no parking since the restaurant is set in the middle of a park located in an old glass greenhouse the atmosphere is just great very light and airy the whole idea behind the restaurant is just neat everything they cook they ve grown meat and seafood come from local farmer partners you can even wander through the greenhouse while you re there there s no menu each week the chefs pick which ingredients they ll be using for the next   days when you sit down the server asks if you have any allergies or specific foods you don t like past that it s up to the chefs you re then served   course   if you go for dinner the food is delicious very fresh beautifully presented that being said i do believe that the food itself is a bit overrated it s good but not amazing plus you re somewhat up a creek if something comes out that you forgot to mention you didn t like case in point my main course ended up being grilled lamb which i strongly dislike the set prices   euro for lunch   for dinner is steep for what you actually get especially considering that alcohol isn t included the waitstaff is great very friendly very attentive overall we thoroughly enjoyed our time at de kas it s definitely worth a trip for the unique experience aloneas this was our one date night on a family trip to europe we pored over our guidebooks to find the perfect spot we were looking for an elegant tasty meal at a less touristed restaurant and we wanted to avoid stuffiness or formality de kas totally fit the bill the restaurant is in the formal municipal greenhouse of amsterdam as it was summer the room was filled with light since the emphasis was on ingredients grown both on site and out on the restaurant s farm the preparations were rather simple the ingredients themselves were fresh and full of flavor and so the meal was a terrific success next time i m in amsterdam i would not hesitate to go therei made a booking after reading reviews on trip advisor it really was a dining experience rather than just another restaurant meal i chose the chefs table option which was fantastic upon arriving at the restaurant we were escorted to the kitchen and sat at a table to the side with a view of all the action we were introduced to the head chef who presented us with each of the courses and explained each dish in detail we also had what seemed like exclusive attention of the sommelier who explained why she had matched each wine to each course after the the first two starters the pasta course the fish course and the main course of guinea fowl we were given a tour by the head chef and shown where our asparagus had been picked from for one of our starters we completed the evening seated at a nice private table in the main restaurant for cheese sherry sweets desert wine cognac and coffee all included in the     euros a head bearing in mind that we both had a glass of champagne upon arrival and   bottles of wine were presnted during the meal along with the sherry desert wine and cognac the drinks bill would have run to more than the   euros at any other place we have eaten at in the last few years bargainde kas is quite possibly one of my top restaurants ever which is saying a lot it was very very good set in the middle of a park it is housed in a huge glasshouse with its own greenhouse where the chefs pick the ingredients freshly for your meal no menus they ask you if there s anything you don t like and then they deliver what s fresh wonderful service spectacular food and our desserts had happy anniversary piped onto them in chocolate a proper occasion restaurant and a delightful treat the price was perfectly reasonable for the quality of the food ad experience in fact i was so intent on lingering over dessert that we very nearly missed our trainlocation is a bit out of the way if you re staying in central amsterdam but it s worth the taxi fare to eat here the main room is beautiful physically one of the nicest spaces i have eaten in for a while food was great a surprise menu of   courses comprising three perfectly sized starters main and dessert staff were friendly and ambience was really great the food was very good set menu for about   per head i think was value for the qualitymy wife and i went there for her birthday a couple of years ago and we were taling about it today having found the menu in an old guide book we both agree that it was the best meal we ve ever had in any restaurant anywhere the welcome the food the cooking the attention to detail all perfect we re going back next yearthe people at de kas have done a terrific job at converting this former greenhouse into a restaurant it was a special occasion so we booked the chefs table which is located inside the kitchen where you can watch the chef and sous chefs preparing all the food as almost the whole kitchen and restaurant is a glass structure the chefs table is surprisingly and refreshingly airy for a set steep but   worth it price you get to try most of what they prepare and accompany it with several wines which change depending on what you are eating i go there every time i m in amsterdamwe ate at de kas in late may what a wonderful evening the atmosphere is beautiful with peaceful gardens glass enclosures modern fittings and lovely environs in general the menu is changed according to what s growing and you get what they serve which was delicious the wait staff are pleasant and informative the wine list was good we totally enjoyed this experience and would definitely go back next time we are in ams and will recommend it to othersthe food is alright the service is okay and the prices are way above average have been there a couple of times for work and for personal reasons but will not be going backyou walk over a bridge and through a park to get to the restaurant you are greeted warmly at the door and seated quickly in a spectacular glass room over champagne extra the menu is explained and you relax and enjoy the beauty each course is outstanding presented beautifully and delicious very fresh and tastywe ate at de kas on april  st four adults while waiting for the ash cloud to go by expectations were high based on reviews and their classy website the three starters were well prepared and portions were generous nothing extravagant straightforward cookery with fresh ingredients the main entree was duck again well prepared with fresh ingredients but not inspired by any means this was a wednesday night and we had a     reservation we were seated at the edge of the restaurant next to the bar the place was nearly empty except what looked like a corporate get together in a back room and two couples seated next to us my husband thought the place reminded him of a high school gymnasium complete with echoes from noise in the kitchen and the sound of wait staff shoes on the hard surface floor the center of the room is set up like a grade school lunch room with long rows of tables down the center we had one bottle of wine moderately priced and three beers the bill was     usd i don t mind paying for great food service and atmosphere but as my title said it was good like your mum s fried chicken and mashed potatoes but not what i would call gourmet or even particularly special the dessert was a confused pairing of rhubarb sorbet a lemon like pudding all over a bit of cake surprisingly unmemorablethe complete down to earth dining experience a glass house restaurant with no menu only what s available from the gardens and local environs today even anyone who does not like vegies will be a convert it s organic but not vego so even carnivores will adore this place if the owner is about ask him for his story a group of us had a wonderful lunch there in march and heard his story we had many good meals over two weeks traveling but all agree that this was the stand out in terms of sights sounds smell and taste all brought together with the story of the place to support something local and global minimum impact to the planet de kas is a place not to be missed on the itinerarylove the atmosphere food is sophisticated service is goodfirst class food and service and nice athmosphere the prices are thereafter but it s worth it for special occasions most of their ingredients are locally sourced some even grown on site they have a good wine list too one of the best restaurants in the citythe setting is gorgeous under the stars in a glass greenhouse and reflects the restaurant s style only fresh local food the service was attentive without being overbearing the food was delicious there is no menu you are served what the kitchen made based on what is fresh with options to opt out based on dislikes and allergies everything is great great wine list tooeating at de kas was one of the highlights of our holiday as far as i remember the owner is was a small farmer he always wanted to open a restaurant and when this greenhouse came up for sale he took his chance on arrival at the restaurant you are greeted warmly and shown to your table your coats are taken at the door and your table no put on the hanger so they hand them to you again when leaving the menu is set with no choice and is prepared based on what has been harvested that day week i was a bit apprehensive at this but you are asked on arrival if you have any food allergies or dislikes which are no problem probably no harm to mention these when booking either there are   courses the starter is actually a selection of   starters each one nicer than the next our main course was pheasant which i d never had but was gorgeous dessert was poached pear with chocolate and custard served in glass very light after the substantial main course the service here was impeccable but not overbearing just right you also felt that you could have stayed at your table all night we spent ages over coffee and didn t feel rused at all on leaving the owner saw us out asked us how our evening had been got our coats and invited us to take freshly picked apples from a basket at the door a really lovely touch all in all a great experience and worth it for a treatwe had high expectations on de kas we read about it and heard people talking very good about it i m sorry to say that we don t agree the atmosphere is outstanding the dining room is very nice and service is almost michelin standard when they don t forget you which happened twice but we had seven   waiters pouring wine serving dishes explaining taste combinations laying out cutlery pouring water and the restaurant was full so over all very good service if service was smooth and elegant the food was the contrary rough and tough a bit too rough the head chef who came out to talk to us after i complained about a dry and boring dish with pheasent said that their cooking style is rough and uncomplicated and that they try to cook in a way that the dishes are going to please as many as possible like the warm oyster the idea is that more people are likely to eat a cooked oyster than a raw one well it doesn t taste like a delicate oyster anymore does it one of the starters was a combo of beetroots served with a mushroom probably grown near if not inside a horse stable it litterally tasted what a horse smells when talking to the head chef about it he said we taste everything and we haven t noticed anything wrong with the mushroom but we also had a few good dishes like the wild salmon delicious and a very mature cheese with an apple syrup and finally a apple compote with zabaionne and chocolate ice cream over all we had a good evening but we re not recomending you making a reservation at de kasi havent been to de kas for a   months and i was not disappointed upon my return the meal had a christmas feel to it this week which was fun but didnt detract at all from the fabulous food as a fussy eater de kas are always able to create something that suits me if i don t like the produce on the planned meal the flavours are magnificnet and the carrot oil this week was intense flavoursome and really unusual the concept is great and the food worth making the journey forbedankt to de kas for providing such a unique setting for dining it is is lovely light and airy my favorite part of the restaurant experience was not the food although the it was delicious and the presentation was beautiful but the pale blue glass water tumbler the rest of the crystal was clear and the blue was perfection particularly since it matched the sky on the bright clear october day we were there the whole place just sparkled in the sunlight first course was tappas large italian green olives marinated zucchini with mustard seeds and a crusty round of bread with olive oil for dipping there were three starters for a prix fixe meat fish and vegetarian the meat starter was a small tender piece of veal topped with gratinee and a leaf of brussel sprout it was sitting on a bed of finely shaved chard and served with hollandaise sauce the vegetarian starter was gnocchi with dill sauce accompanied by rugula almonds and cucumbers the fish starter was two large scallops accompanied by pumpkin puree and topped with parsley then came the entree oven baked halliburt graced with french style green beans and beetroot the hallibut rested on a best of lentils in a cream sauce and was accompanied by a turnip and rugula salad we opted out of the sweet for dessert and instead shared a cheese plate with spanish cabrioles blue french muenster and holland cow cheese from utrecht it came with an apple pear fruit syrup stroop in dutch candied walnuts and fig and walnut black bread all i can say in yum yum p s i was taken there as a birthday treat so i do not know the cost of our lunch with a bottle of wine that daythis restaurant is good for people with organic food habits it is off the beaten track in a hothouse it is trendy and serves a daily menu where you don t choose food is cooked with mostly own vegetables it is fun but i would go there only once for the experiencethis was one of the best dining experiences i have had in years the food was so fresh so well prepared and so delicious they only have a set menu which means you get tremendous value for money so long as you have a taste for most things the setting is incredible i recommend lunch so you can see the gardens etcthis was my best restaurant visit in the netherlands so far in   the location in a glass house a bit away from the street is unique you have to know that is slightly remote to actually find it i think food really good we went for full diner menu as well as wine menu very delicious and interesting combinations they managed to fine the wine which proved a perfect match for each dish waiters were on top of it so full when we left if you want a real nice restauant visit in amsterdam that is the place to goit has been a couple of years since i was last at de kas so i jumped at the opportunity to try it again this week and i had forgotten how incredibly tasty fresh food is the set   course menu with cheese platter as an optional fourth was full of inventive ideas and mixtures of tastes that made every mouthful pure joy the freshness and combinations of food work so well together that it is clear that a great deal of careful planning goes into every menu compliments to the chef and the team the great food was complemented by an equally varied and well thought wine list we settled on a bottle of chassagne montrechet which was exquisite and went well with every bite of every course and as the evening passed everyone is afforded a wonderful sight as the sky around and above changes colour and then into darkness just spectacular great service and very friendly staff who explained the combination of tastes in the food in detail an exceptional dinner that doesn t break the bank i will be back again much sooner than in another two yearsyou can not replicate the senses evoked by experiencing this meal the setting is absolutely one of a kind i can not imagine how anyone who adores amazing food fine service and a wine list you want to take home and pour over for hours would disapprove the overall aesthetics very pleasing in an airy and sophisticated way higher ceilings a welcome change in a city its easy to feel cramped in especially to enjoy a meal here if there was perfect this would be itbrilliant food beautiful atmosphere loved every second i was therei ve been to de kas eight times and used to love it however i feel compelled to write as the last two times it has been noticeably poor and i have had the impression that they re resting on their laurels i went with two guests on saturday   april   the food once inspired rich and delicious was formulaic boring and bland two slices of pink meat lamb for the starter and pork for the main each accompanied with an unimaginative garden salad plus a tasteless dessert of bread and butter pudding with all the consistency of cardboard what happened to the creativity and flavour worse my salad had a nest of greenfly i sent it back discretely and received another salad also with greenfly and no apology perhaps i should have complained loudly the greenfly had all of us at our table nervously checking our food for the rest of the meal another of us found some too not exactly relaxing another problem there was a card on the table offering a set menu for   euros we weren t sure if this was for our meal as no one explained it to us turned out it wasn t we paid   euros each with a couple of glasses of wine but like the greenfly this was another niggle playing at the back of our minds throughout the meal four other concerns they really push the drinks to increase the bill i saw empty tables for the first time the head chef has gone off to klein jansen apparently the free apples they offer as you leave are old and flowery sad to say but this restaurant displays every sign of turning into a money making machine on the back of its fine reputation de kas as it was is over i won t be back againthe kas works with a set menu i really like that in good restaurants and so far i haven t been disappointed in the kas they cook seasonal local organic some of the herbs are grown in the greenhouse in which you re dining most other veggies are sourced nearby and all the meat is biological wine list is quite good although i m no expert service is friendly and fairly easy going but on the ball atmosphere is brilliant you re in a hip greenhouseexcellent food the vegetables were really tasty and they have very good service i will come back for suregreat location good food service leaves room for improvementoriginal setup with yummy organic and extremely local herbs and produce they grow it themselves in the greenhouse and some farmland nearby amsterdamok if you are planning on coming to amsterdam as a tourist by all means avoid the tourist restaurants if you have any respect for your body and if you want your taste buds to party like it s   go eat at de kas the location is briliant peace of heaven on earth the staff is better very friendly and service minded and the food goes beyond all of this i am completely in love with this place i would recommend it to anyone visiting amsterdam be it as a tourist or on business give yourself the besti had a great dinner at this restaurant in the last week of august   from starter to desert the mein player was always vegitable and fruits the cuisine concpet is to maximize tast of vegitable at this restaurant you would find how vegitable is delisiousi went to de kas with two friends that knew already the restaurant what a nice experience this restaurant serves fresh ingredients and the food tastes absolutely lovely we had one   course menu a selection of small starters followed by a main course and dessert     the wine list has good wines at reasonable prices the quality of the products was as good as the service which was accurate and very friendly the interior is very nice and warm in a modern style the public and ambiance was very good i stongly recommend this restaurantthe only reason i did not give the absolute best of best ratings to restaurant de kas is i have not had the pleasure of dining with them since january this year   i enjoy all aspects of the de kas experience the beautiful and tranquil park setting the industrial yet comfortable decor and the anticipation followed by surprise as each course is served by the friendly staff there is always the element of surprise because the menu is set daily according to available ingredients many of which are grown in the very building you are seated a massive former commercial greenhouse facility transformed into a sleek and sophisticated culinary cathedral a visit for lunch is usually my personal choice when i m on my own and you get to see all the fruit veg herbs and flowers surrounding the dining area convincing you that freshness reigns supreme even though the menu is set the waitstaff are trained to inquire of food allergies and dislikes and every effort was made to accommodate a temporary restriction to pepper even though i am not a big meat eater at one anniversary dinner   years ago my hubby and i had the finest prime rib of veal that was the absolute best piece of beef i have had outside argentina the lunch menus are often lighter usually offering seafood or fish the meals start with fresh olives the best bread roll and butter   appetizers then the entre followed by desert desert is extra and some lovely confections beverages are also not included in the meal price and the wine list hasn t disappointed at lunch there is less food thankfully less crowd     the cost and i am more comfortable sitting by myself that than with the evening dining crowd you can watch the kitchen flow behind glass or enjoy peoplewatching and ducks out the magnificent glass walls to views over the beautiful ponds and gardens each meal at de kas has been a memorable experience for me the tram goes right by it see nl for directions and more info bon appetit sandy']"
